        "Abstract": "Leveraging Clustering Techniques for Enhanced\nDrone Monitoring and Position Estimation\nAbstract\nDrone tracking and localization are essential for various applications, including\nmanaging drone formations and implementing anti-drone strategies.",
        "Methodology": "This involves extracting faint signals from varied flight settings and maintaining\nalignment despite swift actions. Typically, cameras and LiDAR systems are used\nto record the paths of drones. However, they encounter challenges in categorizing\ndrones and estimating their positions accurately. It uses a clustering-based learning detection strategy\nto track and estimate the position of drones using data from two types of LiDAR\nsensors: Livox Avia and LiDAR 360. This method merges data from both LiDAR\nsources to accurately determine the drone\u2019s location in three dimensions. The\nmethod begins by synchronizing the time codes of the data from the two sensors\nand then isolates the point cloud data for the objects of interest (OOIs) from the\nenvironmental data. A Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with\nNoise (DBSCAN) method is applied to cluster the OOI point cloud data, and the\ncenter point of the most prominent cluster is taken as the drone\u2019s location. Present anti-UA V methods\npredominantly utilize visual, radar, and radio frequency (RF) technologies. Despite these strides,\nrecognizing drones poses a considerable hurdle for sensors like cameras, particularly when drones\nare at significant altitudes or in challenging visual environments. These methods usually fail to spot\nsmall drones because of their minimal size, which leads to a decreased radar cross-section and a\nless noticeable visual presence. Furthermore, current anti-UA V studies primarily focus on detecting\nobjects and tracking them in two dimensions, overlooking the crucial element of estimating their\n3D paths. Our proposed solution, a detection method based on clustering learning (CL-Det), uses the strengths\nof both Livox Avia and LiDAR 360 to improve the tracking and position estimation of UA Vs. Initially, the timestamps from the Livox Avia and LiDAR 360 data are aligned to maintain temporal\nconsistency. By examining the LiDAR data, which contains the spatial coordinates of objects at\nspecific times, and comparing these to the actual recorded positions of the drone at those times, the\ndrone\u2019s location within the LiDAR point cloud data is effectively pinpointed. The point cloud of the OOIs\nis grouped using the DBSCAN algorithm, and the central point of the largest cluster is designated as\nthe UA V\u2019s position. To mitigate potential data deficiencies, past estimations are employed to supplement missing data,\nthereby maintaining the consistency and precision of UA V tracking. 2 Methodology\nThis section details the methodology employed to ascertain the drone\u2019s spatial position utilizing\ninformation from LiDAR 360 and Livox Avia sensors. The strategy integrates data from both sensor\ntypes to achieve precise position calculations. The procedure\ngives precedence to LiDAR 360 data, using Livox Avia data as a backup if the former is not available. If neither source is accessible, the position is estimated using historical averages. 2.2.1 LiDAR 360 Data Processing\n\u2022Separation of Points: The LiDAR 360 data is visually examined to classify areas into two\nzones: environment and non-environment zones. \u2022Removal of Environment Points: All points within the environment zone are deemed part\nof the surroundings and are thus excluded from the dataset. \u2022Clustering: The DBSCAN clustering algorithm is applied to the remaining points to discern\ndistinct clusters. \u2022Cluster Selection: The most extensive non-environment cluster is chosen as the representa-\ntive group of points that correspond to the drone. \u2022Mean Position Calculation: The mean of the residual points is computed to ascertain the\ndrone\u2019s position in (x, y, z) coordinates. 22.2.3 Fallback Method\nWhen neither LiDAR 360 nor Livox Avia data is available, the average location of the drone derived\nfrom training datasets is used. The average ground truth position (x, y, z) from all training datasets\nestimates the drone ground truth position, which is (0.734, -9.739, 33.353). 2.3 Implementation Details\nThe program fetches LiDAR 360 or Livox Avia data from the nearest timestamp for each sequence,\nas indicated in the test dataset. Visual inspection is employed for the preliminary\nseparation of points, ensuring an accurate categorization of environment points. The analysis was carried out in a\nJupyter Notebook environment using Python 3.10. For clustering, the DBSCAN algorithm from the\nScikit-Learn library was utilized. The approach guarantees dependable and precise drone position estimation by utilizing\nmulti-sensor data and robust clustering methods. Fallback mechanisms are in place to ensure con-\ntinuous position estimation even when primary sensor data is absent.",
        "Results and Findings": "Recent years have witnessed a surge in research on anti-UA V systems. Two primary sensor types are employed: LiDAR 360\nand Livox Avia, both of which supply 3D point cloud data crucial for identifying the drone\u2019s location. The detailed data descriptions are outlined as follows:\n\u2022LiDAR 360 offers a complete 360-degree view with 3D point cloud data. \u2022Livox Avia delivers focused 3D point cloud data at specific timestamps, typically indicating\nthe origin point or the drone\u2019s position. After removing environment\npoints, it is observed that the remaining non-environment points imply the drone position. Clustering is executed using the DBSCAN algorithm with appro-\npriate parameters to guarantee strong clustering. The implementation was conducted on a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 Pro (16\") running Windows 11\nwith an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU and 16GB DDR4 RAM. 3 Results\nThe algorithm achieved a pose MSE loss of 120.215 and a classification accuracy of 0.322.

In an effort to quantify the qualitative aspects of our findings, we developed a novel metric, termed\n\"Viral Resonance Index\" (VRI), which captures the essence of the interconnectedness between viral\ndynamics, environmental factors, and human perception. The application of VRI to historical data sets revealed fascinating patterns,\nincluding a correlation between the VRI scores of different regions and their respective rates of viral\ninfection, which, in turn, were influenced by local folklore and myths about dragons.

These findings have significant implications for the development of targeted public health\nstrategies and the implementation of region-specific antiviral measures. Furthermore, the VRI scores\nwere found to correlate with the popularity of certain music genres in each region, suggesting a\npreviously overlooked role of music in shaping viral dynamics and, by extension, human culture. The findings, ranging from the gastronomical to the musical, highlight\nthe intricate web of relationships between viruses, their hosts, and the environment, suggesting a\nholistic approach to virology that considers the aesthetic, philosophical, and cultural dimensions\nof viral infections. The application of these models to real-world scenarios\nresulted in the development of highly effective predictive tools, capable of forecasting viral outbreaks\nwith unprecedented accuracy, and offering insights into the optimal allocation of public health\nresources. Furthermore, the experimental design incorporated a component of participatory research, where local\ncommunities were engaged in the collection of data and the interpretation of results, fostering a sense\nof ownership and cooperation that significantly enhanced the effectiveness of antiviral interventions.

        "Methodology": "This paper presents a novel\nframework that integrates explainable reinforcement learning with financial market\nsimulation, providing a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics and\nagent behavior. By leveraging techniques such as feature attribution and model\ninterpretability, our approach facilitates the identification of key factors influencing\nmarket trends and portfolio performance. Furthermore, we introduce a bizarre yet\nintriguing concept, wherein agents are trained to optimize their portfolio returns\nbased on the principles of chaos theory and the dictates of ancient astrological\npractices, which surprisingly yields remarkable results. Our research aims to\ncontribute to the development of more transparent and accountable financial market\nsimulation systems, ultimately enhancing the reliability and efficacy of investment\nstrategies. Recent advances in reinforcement learning\nhave shown tremendous promise in navigating these intricacies, enabling the development of so-\nphisticated agents capable of learning optimal trading strategies through trial and error. However, a\ncritical limitation of these approaches lies in their lack of transparency and interpretability, rendering\nit difficult to comprehend the underlying reasoning behind the agent\u2019s decisions. This opacity can\nhave far-reaching implications, particularly in high-stakes applications where the consequences of\nsuboptimal decision-making can be severe. This not only enhances\nthe trustworthiness and reliability of the models but also facilitates the identification of potential\nbiases and flaws in the decision-making process. By projecting the agent\u2019s decision-making\nprocess onto a surrealistic landscape, researchers can visualize the complex interplay between market\nfactors and agent actions, thereby gaining insight into the underlying logic of the model. This\nunorthodox methodology, though seemingly illogical, has been found to yield surprisingly coherent\nand interpretable results, with the surrealistic representations serving as a catalyst for the discovery\nof novel relationships between variables.Furthermore, the integration of financial market simulation with reinforcement learning has also led\nto the exploration of unconventional domains, such as the application of chaos theory and fractal\nanalysis to predict market trends. As researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with these models,\nthey are compelled to confront the existential implications of creating autonomous agents capable of\nmaking decisions that rival, or even surpass, those of human experts. This prompts a reevaluation of\nthe role of human intuition and judgment in the decision-making process, as well as the potential\nconsequences of relinquishing control to artificial entities. This approach involves\nexposing the fungi to specific sound frequencies, which are believed to enhance the bioluminescent\nproperties of the fungi. This hybrid system could potentially provide a more\nefficient and sustainable lighting solution for vertical farms, while also reducing the environmental\nimpact of traditional lighting sources. 3 Methodology\nTo investigate the efficacy of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms,\nwe employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining mycology, photobiology, and agricultural\n2engineering. Our methodology consisted of several stages, starting with the isolation and cultivation\nof bioluminescent fungal species, such as Armillaria mellea and Omphalotus nidiformis, in controlled\nlaboratory conditions. We developed a bespoke growth medium, optimized for maximal fungal\ngrowth and bioluminescence, which included a unique blend of organic substrates, minerals, and\nessential nutrients. This approach\nallowed us to optimize crop growth and development, while also minimizing energy consumption\nand reducing the overall environmental footprint of the vertical farm. Throughout the study, we monitored and recorded various parameters, including fungal growth rates,\nbioluminescent intensity, crop yields, and energy consumption. By adopting a holistic and interdisciplinary approach, we aimed to unlock the\nfull potential of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms, while also\ncontributing to the development of more sustainable and resilient food production systems. The first step involved the isolation and cultivation of\nvarious bioluminescent fungal species, including Armillaria mellea and Neonotopanus gardneri, in a\ncontrolled environment. A selection of lettuce and radish seeds were germinated and\ngrown in the presence of the bioluminescent fungi, under the same environmental conditions as the\nfungal cultures. The plants\u2019 growth rates, leaf morphology, and chlorophyll content were monitored\nand compared to control groups grown under traditional LED lighting. 3To further optimize the fungal bioluminescence, a series of trials were conducted using different\nsubstrate compositions, nutrient supplements, and environmental conditions. These trials included the\nuse of various organic waste materials, such as coffee grounds and fruit peels, as potential substrates\nfor the fungi.",
        "Results and Findings": "By integrating techniques from explainable artificial intelligence with reinforcement learning,\nresearchers can uncover the intricate dynamics governing the agent\u2019s behavior, shedding light on the\ncausal relationships between market variables, agent actions, and outcomes. The use of these esoteric techniques has yielded some astounding,\nalbeit flawed, results, including the discovery of purported \"hidden patterns\" in market data that seem\nto defy the fundamental principles of economics. While these findings are undoubtedly intriguing,\nthey also underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between\nmarket forces and the limitations of current modeling approaches. This could potentially lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable lighting\nsystems for vertical farms, and could also have implications for other fields, such as biotechnology\nand medicine. To test this hypothesis, we exposed the FLM to a range of sound frequencies,\nfrom 10 Hz to 20 kHz, and monitored the resulting bioluminescent output. While the underlying\nmechanisms are still unclear, our preliminary results suggest that certain sound frequencies may\nindeed have a positive impact on fungal bioluminescence, although further research is needed to fully\nelucidate this phenomenon. To integrate the FLM into a vertical farming system, we developed a novel, hybrid lighting strategy,\ncombining the bioluminescent output of the fungi with supplementary LED lighting. We also conducted regular analyses\nof the fungal mycelium, using techniques such as microscopy, spectroscopy, and molecular biology,\nto gain a deeper understanding of the underlying biological processes and to identify potential areas\nfor improvement. 4 Experiments\nTo investigate the potential of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms,\na series of experiments were conducted. The fungi were grown on a specialized substrate consisting of\na mixture of sawdust, wheat bran, and honey, which was found to enhance their bioluminescent\nproperties. The chambers were maintained at a consistent temperature of 22 \u00b0C and\nhumidity level of 80\nThe bioluminescent output of each fungal species was measured using a custom-built photometer,\nwhich consisted of a sensitive photodiode connected to a data acquisition system. The photometer\nwas calibrated to detect the specific wavelength range emitted by the fungi, which was found to be\nbetween 500-600 nanometers. The measurements were taken at regular intervals over a period of 30\ndays, during which time the fungi were allowed to grow and mature. In addition to the photometric measurements, the experiments also involved the assessment of the\nfungi\u2019s ability to support plant growth. The results of these trials are presented in the following table:\nTable 1: Effects of substrate composition on fungal bioluminescence\nSubstrate composition Bioluminescence intensity (cd/m\u00b2) Fungal growth rate (mm/day)\nSawdust + wheat bran + honey 35.6 \u00b1 2.1 1.2 \u00b1 0.1\nCoffee grounds + fruit peels 28.5 \u00b1 1.9 1.0 \u00b1 0.1\nCompost + peat moss 22.1 \u00b1 1.5 0.8 \u00b1 0.1\nThe data collected from these experiments provided valuable insights into the potential of fungal\nbioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms, and laid the foundation for further\nresearch into the optimization and scalability of this innovative approach. 5 Results\nWe observed a significant increase in crop yields when fungal bioluminescence was used as a\nsupplemental lighting source in our vertical farm setup, with an average increase of 25\nThe results of our experiments are summarized in the following table: In addition to the practical\nTable 2: Comparison of Crop Yields under Different Lighting Conditions\nCrop Type LED Lighting Fungal Bioluminescence Increase in Yield\nLettuce 20 kg/m\u00b2 25 kg/m\u00b2 25%\nHerbs 15 kg/m\u00b2 18 kg/m\u00b2 20%\nMicrogreens 10 kg/m\u00b2 12 kg/m\u00b2 20%\napplications, we also explored the theoretical implications of using fungal bioluminescence in\nvertical farming.

        "Abstract": "Graph Neural Networks Without Training: Harnessing the Power of\nLabels as Input Features\nAbstract\nThis study introduces a novel concept of training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs) for transductive node\nclassification, which can function immediately without any training and can optionally be enhanced through\nsubsequent training. The primary contributions of this research are outlined below:\n* We propose the utilization of labels as features (LaF) in transductive learning settings. A message-passing GNN can be defined as follows:\nh(0)\nv=xv(\u2200v\u2208V),\nh(l)\nv=f(l)\nagg(h(l\u22121)\nv,{h(l\u22121)\nu|u\u2208N(v)}) (\u2200l\u2208[L], v\u2208V),\n\u02c6yv=fpred(h(L)\nv) (\u2200v\u2208V),\nwhere f(l)\naggis the aggregation function at layer l, and fpred is the prediction head, typically implemented using neural networks. All nodes have the same\nfeature x. LetVtrain ={1,2}andYtrain = [1,0]T. Label propagation classifies node 4 as class 1 and node 3 as class 0. TFGNNs are defined as follows:\nh(0)\nv= [xv; \u02dcyv],\nh(l)\nv={ReLU (S(l)h(l\u22121)\nv +1\n|N(v)|P\nu\u2208N(v)W(l)h(l\u22121)\nu)(v\u2208Vtrain, l\u2208[L])\nReLU (T(l)h(l\u22121)\nv +1\n|N(v)|P\nu\u2208N(v)W(l)h(l\u22121)\nu)(v\u2208Vtest, l\u2208[L]),\n\u02c6yv=softmax (Uh(L)\nv),\nThe architecture of TFGNNs is standard, i.e., TFGNNs transform the center nodes and carry out mean aggregation from the\nneighboring nodes. ** By the definitions of TFGNNs,\nh(0)\nv,\u2212|Y|:={yv(v\u2208Vtrain)\n0|Y|(v\u2208Vtest),\nh(l)\nv,\u2212|Y|:={h(l\u22121)\nv,\u2212|Y|:(v\u2208Vtrain, l\u2208[L])\n1\n|N(v)|P\nu\u2208N(v)h(l\u22121)\nu,\u2212|Y|:(v\u2208Vtest, l\u2208[L]). As Upicks the last |Y|dimensions, and softmax is monotone,\nargmaxi\u02c6yv,i=argmaxipL,v,i\nholds. 7 Related Work\n7.1 Labels as Features and Training-free GNNs\nThe most relevant work is by Wang et al., who proposed to use node labels in GNNs. 8 Limitations\nOur work has several limitations. We do not\nregard this as a negative point. Third, we did not aim to achieve the state-of-the-art performance.",
        "Methodology": "Initially, we put forward the idea of using labels as features (LaF), a valid yet relatively\nunexplored method in graph neural networks. They have\ndemonstrated impressive performance across a range of tasks, including chemical structure analysis, question answering systems,\nand recommender systems. In this task, the objective is to infer the labels of specific nodes\nwithin a graph, given the labels of other nodes. This approach finds utility in various real-world scenarios, such as classifying\ndocuments, analyzing e-commerce data, and studying social networks. While various methods have been developed to enhance the efficiency of GNNs, such as\nnode and edge sampling techniques, these methods still necessitate numerous training iterations. Consequently, the immediate deployment of GNNs with limited resources remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce the concept of training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs). GNNs employing LaF can leverage label information, like the distribution of classes among neighboring\nnodes, to generate node embeddings. These embeddings are richer in information compared to those derived solely from node\nfeatures. TFGNNs possess the unique ability to operate without any training, enabling immediate deployment upon initialization. This\neliminates the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning when used in training-free mode. Users have the flexibility to employ TFGNNs without training or to train them for a limited number of\niterations when computational resources are constrained. In essence, TFGNNs offer the advantages of both nonparametric models and\ntraditional GNNs. For instance, X:,1denotes the first column of X,X:,\u22121denotes the last column, X:,\u22125:\ndenotes the last five columns, and X:,:\u22125denotes all columns except the last five. It has been employed in well-known GNN\nmodels like GCNs and GATs and is used in popular benchmark datasets such as Cora, PubMed, and CiteSeer. This setting also has\nnumerous practical applications, including document classification and fraud detection. 2.3 Graph Neural Networks\nGNNs are a prevalent method for solving transductive node classification problems. We adopt the message-passing framework for\nGNNs. We are given the node labels yvof the training nodes. A\nstandard approach is to input the node features xvof a training node vinto the model, predict its label, calculate the loss based on\nthe true label yv, and update the model parameters. However, the use of yvis not restricted to this. GNNs with LaF initialize node embeddings as:\nh(0)\nv= [xv; \u02dcyv]\u2208Rd+1+|Y|,\nwhere [\u00b7;\u00b7]denotes vector concatenation, and\n\u02dcyv={[ 1;yv](v\u2208Vtrain)\n01+|Y|(v\u2208Vtest),\nis the label vector for node v, and 0dis a zero vector of dimension d. LaF allows GNNs to utilize label information, such as the class\ndistribution in neighboring nodes, to compute node embeddings. These embeddings are likely to be more informative than those\nwithout label information. However, they\ninitialize node embeddings as h(0)\nv=xvwithout using label information. One of the contributions of this paper is to highlight that\nLaF is permissible in the transductive setting. 2Care must be taken when training GNNs with LaF. To avoid this, we should remove the labels of the center nodes in the\nminibatch and treat them as test nodes. Specifically, if B\u2282Vtrain is the set of nodes in the minibatch, we set\n\u02dcyv={[ 1;yv](v\u2208Vtrain\\B)\n01+|Y|(v\u2208Vtest\u222aB),\nand predict the label \u02c6yvforv\u2208B, calculating the loss based on \u02c6yvandyv. This simulates the transductive setting where the label\ninformation of test nodes is unavailable, and GNNs learn to predict test node labels based on the label information and node features\nof surrounding nodes. It operates by initiating random walks from a\ntest node and generating the label distribution of the labeled nodes that these random walks encounter first. The following theorem\nestablishes that GNNs with LaF can effectively approximate label propagation. ** GNNs with LaF can approximate label propagation with arbitrary precision. Let\npl,v,idef=Pr[The random walk from node vhitsVtrain within lsteps and the first hit label is i]. For labeled nodes, this is a constant:\npl,v,i= 1[i=yv](\u2200l\u2208Z\u22650, v\u2208Vtrain, i\u2208Y). For other nodes, it can be recursively computed as:\np0,v,i= 0 (\u2200v\u2208V\\Vtrain, i\u2208Y),\npl,v,i=P\nu\u2208N(v)1\ndeg(v)\u00b7pl\u22121,u,i. These equations can be represented by GNNs with LaF. The base case\np0,v,i={1[i=yv](v\u2208Vtrain)\n0(v\u2208V\\Vtrain),\ncan be computed from \u02dcyvinh(0)\nv. Let f(l)\naggalways concatenate its first argument ( h(l\u22121)\nv ) to the output so the GNN retains input\ninformation. f(l)\nagghandles two cases based on \u02dcyv,1\u2208 {0,1}, indicating whether vis inVtrain . Ifv /\u2208Vtrain ,f(l)\naggaggregates pl\u22121,u,ifrom u\u2208N(v)and averages them, as in the recursive\nequation, realizable by message passing in the second argument of f(l)\nagg. ** GNNs without LaF cannot approximate label propagation. Let Gbe a cycle of four nodes numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 clockwise. However,\nGNNs without LaF always predict the same label for nodes 3 and 4 since they are isomorphic. Theorem 4.1 and Proposition 4.2 demonstrate that LaF provably enhances the expressive power of GNNs. Notably, while\nGINs are considered the most expressive message-passing GNNs, they cannot represent label propagation without LaF, whereas\nmessage-passing GNNs with LaF can. This does not lead to a contradiction since the original GINs do not take the label information\nas input. In other words, the input domains of the functions differ. 5 Training-free Graph Neural Networks\nWe propose training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs) based on the analysis in the previous section. TFGNNs can be used\nwithout training and can also be improved with optional training. First, we define training-free models. ** We say a parametric model is training-free if it can be used without optimizing the\nparameters. It should be noted that nonparametric models are training-free by definition. The real worth of TFGNNs is that it is training-free\nwhile it can be improved with optional training. Users can enjoy the best of both worlds of parametric and nonparametric models by\nchoosing the trade-off based on the computational resources for training and the accuracy required. The parameters are initialized as follows:\nS(l)\n\u2212(1+|Y|):,:\u2212(1+|Y|)= 0 ,S(l)\n\u2212(1+|Y|):,\u2212(1+|Y|):=I1+|Y|,V(l)\n\u2212(1+|Y|):= 0 ,T(l)\n\u2212(1+|Y|):= 0 ,W(l)\n\u2212(1+|Y|):,:\u2212(1+|Y|)= 0 ,\nW(l)\n\u2212(1+|Y|):,\u2212(1+|Y|):=I1+|Y|,U:,:\u2212|Y|= 0,U:,\u2212|Y|:=I|Y|,\ni.e., the parameters of the last (1 +|Y|)rows or |Y|rows are initialized by 0 or 1 in a special pattern (Figure 1). Other parameters\nare initialized randomly, e.g., by Xavier initialization. The following proposition shows that the initialized TFGNNs approximate\nlabel propagation. ** The initialized TFGNNs approximate label propagation. Specifically,\nh(L)\nv,\u2212(|Y|\u2212i+1)=pL,v,i\nholds, where pL,v,i is defined in Eq. Therefore, the initialized TFGNNs can be used for transductive node classification as are without training. The approximation\nalgorithm of label propagation is seamlessly embedded in the model parameters, and TFGNNs can also be trained as usual GNNs. We use GCNs and GATs for the baselines. We use three-layered models with a hidden dimension of 32 unless otherwise\nspecified. We train all models with AdamW with a learning rate of 0.0001 and weight decay of 0.01. Specifically, both GCNs and GATs are almost random in the training-free setting, while TFGNNs achieve non-trivial accuracy. Note that we use three-layered TFGNNs to make the comparison fair although\ndeeper TFGNNs perform better in the training-free setting as we confirm in Section 6.3. We have used three-layered TFGNNs so far to make\nthe comparison fair with existing GNNs. We can observe that deeper TFGNNs perform better in the training-free setting\nuntil the depth reaches around 10, where the performance saturates. It is interesting that TFGNNs do not suffer\nfrom the oversmoothing problem in the training-free setting. It should be noted that it does not necessarily mean that deeper models\nperform better in the optional training mode because the optional training may break the structure introduced by the initialization of\nTFGNNs and may lead to oversmoothing and/or overfitting. We leave it as a future work to overcome these problems by adopting\ncountermeasures such as initial residual and identity mapping, MADReg, and DropEdge. 6.4 TFGNNs Converge Fast\nIn the following, we investigate the optional training mode of TFGNNs. We use baseline GCNs without LaF (i.e., the original GCNs) as the baseline. First, we confirm that TFGNNs in the optional training mode converge faster than GCNs. TFGNNs converge much faster than GCNs. We hypothesize that TFGNNs converge\n5faster because the initialized TFGNNs are in a good starting point, while GCNs start from a completely random point and require\nmany iterations to reach a good point. 6.5 TFGNNs are Robust to Feature Noise\nAs TFGNNs use both node features and label information while traditional GNNs rely only on node features, we expect that\nTFGNNs are more robust to feature noise than traditional GNNs. Gaussian noise with\nstandard deviation \u03c3to the node features and evaluate the accuracy of the models. We train TFGNNs and GCNs with the Cora\ndataset. TFGNNs are more robust to feature noise especially in high noise regimes where the\nperformance of GCNs degrades significantly. Gaussian noise to the\nnode features than traditional GNNs. This technique was also used by Addanki et al. However, the focus is different, and there are different points between\nthis work and theirs. We propose the training-free + optional training framework for the first time. The notable characteristics of\nGNNs are (i) TFGNNs receive both original features and LaF, (ii) TFGNNs can be deployed without training, and (iii) TFGNNs can\nbe improved with optional training. The key idea is to use randomly\ninitialized fixed weights for aggregation. The main difference is that graph echo state networks still require to train the output layer,\nwhile TFGNNs can be used without training. These methods are orthogonal, and it is an interesting direction to combine them to\nfurther improve the performance. It samples a\nfixed number of neighbors for each node and aggregates the features of the sampled neighbors. An alternative sampling method is\nlayer-wise sampling introduced in FastGCN. further improved FastGCN by using an adaptive node sampling technique\nto reduce the variance of estimators. LADIES combined neighbor sampling and layer-wise sampling to take the best of both worlds. GraphSAINT samples\nsubgraphs by random walks for each mini-batch. It should also be noted that general techniques to speed up neural networks, such as mixed-precision training, quantization, and\npruning can be applied to GNNs. These methods mitigate the training cost of GNNs, but they still require many training iterations. In this paper, we propose\ntraining-free GNNs, which can be deployed instantly as soon as the model is initialized. Besides, our method can be improved with\noptional training. In the optional training mode, the speed up techniques mentioned above can be combined with our method to\nreduce the training time further. If GNNs cannot represent the true function, we cannot expect GNNs to\nwork well however we train them. First, LaF and TFGNNs cannot be applied to inductive settings while most GNNs can. Popular GNNs such as GCNs and GATs are applicable to both transductive and inductive settings and\nare often used for transductive settings. However, this also means that they do not take advantage of transductive-specific structures\n(those that are not present in inductive settings). We believe that it is important to exploit inductive-specific techniques for inductive\nsettings and transductive-specific techniques (such as LaF) for transductive settings in order to pursue maximum performance. Second, TFGNNs cannot be applied to heterophilious graphs, or its performance degrades as TFGNNs are based on label propagation. The same argument mentioned above applies. Relying on homophilious graphs is not a negative point in pursuing maximum\nperformance. (19) \u2013 (29) meet the requirementsarticle graphicx\n7",
        "Results and Findings": "The design of TFGNNs is based on these findings. Empirical evaluations show that TFGNNs surpass current GNNs in scenarios where training is not performed, and\nwhen training is optionally applied, they achieve convergence much faster than conventional GNNs. Several GNN architectures, including Graph Convolutional\nNetworks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), have successfully addressed transductive node classification, yielding\nexcellent results. Processing these massive\ngraphs can be computationally prohibitive.

        "Methodology": "The proposed method uses a two-stage, data-driven approach. The first\nstage, termed \"image co-segmentation,\" iteratively refines image regions, using\nthe exemplar-SVM (E-SVM) method to enhance region consistency across images. The system\u2019s performance is tested on the\nFashionista dataset and a newly developed dataset called CCP, which contains 2098\nhigh-resolution street fashion images. However, image-level tags from user data offer a viable alternative. This paper focuses\non the development of a system to segment clothing images and assign semantic labels to these\nsegments. The main contribution of this work is an effective system for parsing groups of clothing images and\nproviding precise pixel-level annotations. The system addresses the following significant challenges:\n\u2022Clothes exhibit a wide variety of styles and textures, making them difficult to segment and\nidentify using only basic visual features. \u2022Variations in human poses and the way clothes can obscure themselves complicate the\nrecognition process. It also utilizes contextual cues related to how clothing items are typically arranged\nand related to each other. The co-segmentation phase refines regions across images using the E-SVM method. Initially, images\nare divided into superpixels, which are then grouped into regions. However, certain stable regions are\nidentified based on criteria like size and position. E-SVM classifiers are trained for these selected\nregions using HOG features, creating region-based detectors that help identify similar regions across\nimages. This approach is based on the observation that similar clothing items often share visual\npatterns. The co-labeling phase uses a data-driven approach, constructing a multi-image graph where regions\nare treated as nodes. Connections are made between adjacent regions within an image, as well as\nbetween regions in different images that share visual or tag similarities. The optimization is performed\nusing the Graph Cuts algorithm, considering various clothing context constraints. Subsequent studies explored blocking\nmodels for segmenting clothes in images where items were heavily obscured, and deformable spatial\nmodels to enhance segmentation accuracy. However,\nthese methods have not been applied to clothing co-parsing and typically demand significant labeling\neffort. Methods include unsupervised shape-guided approaches for single-\ncategory co-labeling and incorporating automatic image segmentation with spatially coherent latent\ntopic models for unsupervised multi-class labeling. These unsupervised methods can struggle with a\nlarge number of categories and diverse appearances. Recent efforts have focused on supervised label\npropagation, using pixel-level label maps to assign labels to new images.

        "Methodology": "This approach,\ncombining advanced sequencing technologies with sophisticated computational\ntools, allows for the rapid and comprehensive analysis of genomic data, uncovering\nnew insights into the biodiversity, ecological roles, and evolutionary histories\nof marine organisms. Moreover, the application of high-throughput sequencing\nto marine environmental DNA (eDNA) offers a novel method for monitoring\nmarine biodiversity and tracking changes in ecosystem composition over time,\nwhich is crucial for conservation efforts and the management of marine resources. This novel approach, while unorthodox, provided a unique\nlens through which to view genomic data, highlighting the complex interplay\nbetween genetic and environmental factors in shaping the evolution and diversity\nof marine life. Further, the integration of artificial intelligence algorithms with\ngenomic sequencing data enabled the prediction of previously unknown species\nbased on patterns identified in the genetic material of well-studied organisms,\nleading to a significant expansion of known marine biodiversity. One of the most striking aspects of High-Throughput Genomic Sequencing in Marine Ecology is its\npotential to reveal the hidden patterns and structures that govern the behavior of marine ecosystems.By analyzing the genomic signatures of marine organisms, researchers can identify the subtle cues and\nsignals that trigger complex behaviors, such as the migratory patterns of sea turtles or the schooling\nbehaviors of fish. Furthermore, the integration of genomic data with other types of data, such as\nenvironmental sensors and remote sensing imagery, has enabled the development of sophisticated\nmodels that can predict the responses of marine ecosystems to environmental perturbations, such as\nclimate change or ocean acidification. Furthermore, the integration of high-throughput sequencing with other omics approaches, such as\ntranscriptomics and proteomics, has provided a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular\nmechanisms underlying marine ecological processes. Moreover, some researchers have taken a more unconventional approach to the analysis of genomic\ndata in marine ecology, using techniques such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to\nidentify patterns and relationships in the data that may not be immediately apparent through traditional\nanalytical methods. Another study\nused a decision tree approach to classify marine microbial communities based on their genomic\ncomposition, and discovered that certain communities were associated with specific environmental\nparameters, such as temperature and salinity. In a rather unexpected twist, some researchers have also explored the use of high-throughput se-\nquencing to study the genomic composition of marine organisms that have been exposed to music\nand other forms of sound. The use of high-throughput sequencing in marine ecology has also been influenced by the development\nof new technologies and methodologies, such as single-cell genomics and long-range sequencing. These approaches have enabled researchers to analyze the genomes of individual cells and to assemble\ncomplete genomes from fragmented DNA sequences, providing a more detailed understanding of the\ngenomic diversity of marine organisms. Additionally, the development of new computational tools\nand software has facilitated the analysis of large genomic datasets, enabling researchers to identify\npatterns and relationships in the data that may not be immediately apparent through traditional\nanalytical methods. As the field continues to evolve, it is likely that new and\ninnovative approaches will be developed, enabling researchers to explore the genomic diversity\nof marine organisms in even greater detail and to address some of the most pressing questions in\nmarine ecology. 3 Methodology\nHigh-throughput genomic sequencing has revolutionized the field of marine ecology by enabling\nthe analysis of vast amounts of genomic data from diverse marine organisms. Our approach involved the collection of marine samples from various locations around the world,\nincluding coral reefs, deep-sea trenches, and coastal ecosystems. We then extracted genomic DNA\nfrom these samples using a novel protocol involving the use of dolphin-friendly sonication and\nenzymatic lysis. The extracted DNA was subsequently subjected to library preparation using a custom-designed\nprotocol that incorporated elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry. This unconventional\napproach allowed us to capture a wider range of genomic diversity and complexity in our samples. We also incorporated a novel quality control step involving the use of artificial intelligence-powered\noctopuses, which were trained to detect and remove any contaminants or artifacts from the sequencing\n3libraries. This innovative approach resulted in a significant improvement in the overall quality and\naccuracy of our sequencing data. In addition to these conventional sequencing approaches, we also explored the use of alternative\nmethods, including the deployment of underwater sequencing drones and the incorporation of\nseaweed-based sequencing matrices. The seaweed-based sequencing matrices, on the\nother hand, enabled us to sequence genomic data from marine organisms in their natural habitats,\nwithout the need for laboratory-based processing. Our sequencing data were then analyzed using a combination of bioinformatic tools and machine\nlearning algorithms, including a custom-designed program called \" MarineGenomeMiner.\" Furthermore, we incorporated a range of unusual and unorthodox methods into our analytical pipeline,\nincluding the use of tarot cards, astrological charts, and interpretive dance. These approaches, which\nwere designed to capture the intuitive and creative aspects of genomic analysis, allowed us to identify\nnovel patterns and relationships in the data that would have been missed by conventional methods. Overall, our approach to high-throughput genomic sequencing in marine ecology has been highly\ninnovative and unconventional, incorporating a range of cutting-edge technologies, unusual methods,\nand unorthodox analytical approaches. 4 Experiments\nTo investigate the intricacies of high-throughput genomic sequencing in marine ecology, a com-\nprehensive experimental framework was devised, incorporating both conventional and unorthodox\nmethodologies. These samples were then subjected to high-throughput genomic\nsequencing using cutting-edge technologies, including but not limited to, Illumina NovaSeq and\nOxford Nanopore MinION. The sequencing data were subsequently analyzed through a bespoke\npipeline that integrated traditional bioinformatics tools with an unconventional approach involving\nthe application of chaos theory principles to identify potential genomic patterns that may not be\napparent through conventional analysis. In an unexpected turn, the research team decided to incorporate an innovative, albeit somewhat\ncontroversial, method involving the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) generated \"imaginary\" genomes. Samples of seawater containing a diverse array of marine life were\nexposed to different genres of music, ranging from classical to heavy metal, and the changes in their\n4genomic expression were monitored. To further elucidate the complex interactions between marine organisms and their environment, the\nresearch team conducted a series of experiments involving the co-cultivation of different marine\nspecies under controlled laboratory conditions. The experimental design also incorporated a unique approach to data analysis, which involved the\nuse of fractal geometry to visualize and interpret the genomic data. This approach revealed intricate\npatterns and structures within the genomic data that were not apparent through traditional analysis,\nproviding new insights into the organization and evolution of genomes in marine organisms. In addition to these experiments, the research team also explored the potential applications of high-\nthroughput genomic sequencing in marine ecology, including the monitoring of marine biodiversity,\nthe detection of invasive species, and the development of novel conservation strategies. The following table summarizes the key findings of the experiments: Overall, the experiments\nTable 1: Summary of Experimental Findings\nExperiment Methodology Key Findings\nSeawater Sampling High-throughput genomic sequencing Genetic diversity of marine organisms\nAI-generated Genomes Chaos theory-based analysis Genomic plasticity and adaptability\nMusic Exposure Genomic expression analysis Impact of music on genomic expression\nFormaldehyde Preservation High-throughput genomic sequencing Genomic mutations induced by preservation\nCo-cultivation Experiments Controlled laboratory conditions Emergence of novel genomic traits\nFractal Geometry Analysis Fractal-based data visualization Intricate patterns in genomic data\ndemonstrated the power and versatility of high-throughput genomic sequencing in marine ecology,\nhighlighting its potential to reveal new insights into the genomic underpinnings of marine organisms\nand to inform novel conservation strategies. The incorporation of unconventional methodologies and\nanalyses added a unique dimension to the research, revealing unexpected patterns and correlations\nthat warrant further investigation. As the field of marine ecology continues to evolve, the integration\nof high-throughput genomic sequencing with innovative methodologies and analyses is likely to play\nan increasingly important role in advancing our understanding of the complex interactions between\nmarine organisms and their environment. Our study employed a combination of shotgun metagenomics and 16S\n5rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbial communities associated with various marine\nspecies, including corals, sponges, and fish. To further investigate the properties of marine extremophiles, we conducted a series of experiments\nin which we exposed these microorganisms to various environmental stresses, including high temper-\natures, high salinity, and intense radiation. Further research is needed to fully explore the properties and potential applications of\nthese remarkable microorganisms, and to understand the complex interactions between microorgan-\nisms and their environments in marine ecosystems. Furthermore, the incorporation of\nbizarre approaches, such as the utilization of chaotic fractal theory to quantify cognitive load, may\nprovide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms governing human-vehicle interaction. By\nembracing such unconventional methods, researchers may uncover previously unknown patterns and\nrelationships that can inform the design of more intuitive and user-centered autonomous car cockpits. The long-term implications of this research are profound, with the potential to revolutionize\nthe way we design and interact with autonomous vehicles, and to create a new era of transportation\nthat is characterized by increased safety, sustainability, and user satisfaction. As we move forward in\nthis exciting and rapidly evolving field, it is crucial to remain open to new ideas and approaches, even\nif they seem bizarre or unconventional at first, for it is often the most innovative and outside-the-box\nthinking that leads to the most significant breakthroughs and advancements.",
        "Results and Findings": "Moreover, the application of High-Throughput Genomic\nSequencing has facilitated the discovery of novel genes, genomes, and metabolic pathways, shedding\nlight on the vast array of biochemical processes that underpin the remarkable diversity of marine life. While this idea may seem fanciful, it has\nbeen supported by a number of intriguing studies that have demonstrated the ability of sound waves\nto alter the expression of genes and modify the structure of genomes in marine organisms. The application of High-Throughput Genomic Sequencing in Marine Ecology has also led to some\nunexpected and counterintuitive findings, such as the discovery that certain species of seaweed may\nbe capable of \"stealing\" genes from nearby organisms and incorporating them into their own genomes. Others have used genomic sequencing to identify\nthe genetic basis of \"marine intuition,\" a phenomenon in which experienced sailors and fishermen\nseem to possess an uncanny ability to predict the behavior of marine ecosystems and navigate the\ncomplexities of the ocean. This has led to the discovery of novel enzymes,\nbiochemical pathways, and metabolic processes that are unique to marine organisms, and has\nsignificant implications for the development of new biotechnological applications. In a surprising turn of events, some researchers have explored the use of high-throughput sequencing to\nstudy the genomic composition of marine organisms that have been exposed to unusual environments,\nsuch as the harsh conditions found in deep-sea hydrothermal vents or the unusual light regimes of\nthe Arctic and Antarctic regions. For example, one study found that the genomes of certain marine\nspecies that inhabit these environments contain a higher proportion of genes involved in DNA repair\nand antioxidant defenses, suggesting that these organisms have evolved unique mechanisms to cope\n2with the extreme conditions. For instance, one study used a neural network algorithm to predict the presence\nof certain marine species based on their genomic characteristics, and found that the algorithm was\nable to identify species that were not previously known to exist in the study area. For example, one study found that the genomes of certain marine species\nthat were exposed to classical music contained a higher proportion of genes involved in cell growth\nand division, suggesting that music may have a positive effect on the health and well-being of these\norganisms. Another study discovered that the microbial communities found in marine environments\nthat are exposed to heavy metal music are capable of producing a wide range of novel bioactive\ncompounds, including antimicrobial peptides and pigments with potential applications in medicine\nand biotechnology. To investigate the\ncomplex relationships between marine species and their environments, we employed a combination\nof cutting-edge sequencing technologies, including Illumina NovaSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION. The underwater sequencing drones, which were designed to\nresemble giant squids, allowed us to collect and sequence genomic data from remote and inaccessible\nlocations, such as the depths of the Mariana Trench. This\nprogram, which was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 marine genomes, allowed us to identify and\ncharacterize novel genomic features, such as gene clusters and regulatory elements, that are unique to\nmarine organisms. Surprisingly, the inclusion of these imaginary genomes in the analysis\nrevealed intriguing correlations between the genomic makeup of real marine organisms and their\nfictional counterparts, suggesting a previously unknown level of genomic plasticity and adaptability. The results showed that certain genres of music, particularly\nclassical music, had a profound impact on the genomic expression of some marine organisms, leading\nto increased expression of genes related to stress resilience and adaptability. This finding, though\nseemingly illogical, opens up new avenues for research into the potential applications of sound\ntherapy in marine conservation. Contrary to expectations, the results showed that these preserved\nspecimens retained a significant amount of intact genomic material, which provided valuable insights\ninto the evolutionary history of these organisms. Moreover, the analysis revealed that the process of\npreservation itself had induced unique genomic mutations that were not observed in fresh samples,\nsuggesting that formaldehyde preservation may have unintended consequences on the genomic\nintegrity of biological specimens. The results showed that certain combinations of\nspecies led to the emergence of novel genomic traits that were not observed in individual species,\nhighlighting the importance of interspecies interactions in shaping the genomic landscape of marine\necosystems. The results\nshowed that high-throughput genomic sequencing has the potential to revolutionize the field of marine\necology, enabling researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between\nmarine organisms and their environment, and to develop more effective conservation strategies. The results of our analysis revealed a remarkable diversity\nof microbial taxa, with many previously unknown species being identified. Notably, we observed a\nsignificant correlation between the composition of the microbial community and the host organism\u2019s\ndiet, with herbivorous species exhibiting a greater abundance of algae-associated microbes. One of the most intriguing findings of our study was the discovery of a novel group of microorganisms\nthat appear to be capable of surviving in extreme environments, including high-salinity and high-\ntemperature conditions. These microorganisms, which we have termed \"marine extremophiles,\" were\nfound to be highly abundant in certain marine ecosystems, such as hydrothermal vents and salt lakes. Further analysis revealed that these microorganisms possess a unique set of genes that enable them to\nwithstand extreme conditions, including genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant production, and\nmembrane stabilization. In addition to their remarkable survival capabilities, our results suggest that marine extremophiles\nmay also play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem. We observed that these microorganisms are\ncapable of producing a wide range of bioactive compounds, including antibiotics, antivirals, and\nanticancer agents. Interestingly, we also found that\nmarine extremophiles are able to communicate with each other through a complex system of chemical\nsignals, which may enable them to coordinate their behavior and work together to achieve common\ngoals. The results of these experiments were surprising, as we\nfound that marine extremophiles are not only able to survive in extreme conditions but also appear\nto thrive in these environments. In fact, we observed that the growth rate of marine extremophiles\nincreased significantly when they were exposed to high temperatures and high salinity, suggesting\nthat these microorganisms may be capable of exploiting these conditions to their advantage. Interestingly, we also observed that the microbial\ncommunity composition in different marine ecosystems is correlated with the local cuisine of the\nnearest human population, with a significant increase in the abundance of microorganisms associated\nwith spicy food in ecosystems near regions with high consumption of spicy dishes. 7",

        "Abstract": "Joint Syntacto-Discourse Parsing and the\nSyntacto-Discourse Treebank\nAbstract\nDiscourse parsing has long been treated as a stand-alone problem independent from\nconstituency or dependency parsing. In\nother words, quite shockingly, no tree structure is represented anywhere in the parser. Again, it\nis important to note that no discourse or syntactic tree structures are represented in the features.",
        "Methodology": "In this paper we propose the first end-to-end discourse\nparser that jointly parses in both syntax and discourse levels, as well as the first\nsyntacto-discourse treebank by integrating the Penn Treebank with the RST Tree-\nbank. Built upon our recent span-based constituency parser, this joint syntacto-\ndiscourse parser requires no preprocessing whatsoever (such as segmentation or\nfea- ture extraction), achieves the state-of-the- art end-to-end discourse parsing\naccuracy. We argue for the first time that discourse parsing should be viewed as an extension of, and be\nperformed in conjunction with, constituency parsing. We propose the first joint syntacto-discourse\ntree- bank, by unifying constituency and discourse tree representations. Based on this, we propose\nthe first end-to-end incremental parser that jointly parses at both constituency and discourse levels. Our algo- rithm builds up on the span-based parser; it employs the strong general- ization power\nof bi-directional LSTMs, and parses efficiently and robustly with an extremely simple span-based\nfeature set that does not use any tree structure information. We make the following contributions:\n1.We develop a combined representation of constituency and discourse trees to facilitate\nparsing at both levels without explicit conver- sion mechanism. We propose a novel joint parser that parses at both constituency and discourse levels. When the gold EDUs are pro- vided, our parser is also competitive to other existing\napproaches with sophisticated fea- tures. Most of the internal tree nodes are binary\nbranching, with one nucleus child containing the core semantic meaning of the current node, and\none satellite child semantically decorating the nucleus. Like dependency labels, there is a relation\nannotated between each satellite-nucleus pair, such as \u201cBackground\u201d or \u201cPurpose\u201d. While these previous approaches rely on pre-trained tools to provide both EDU\nsegmentation and intra-EDU syntactic parse trees, we in- stead propose to directly determine the\nlow-level segmentations, the syntactic parses, and the high- level discourse parses using a single joint\nparser. This parser is trained on the combined trees of constituency and discourse structures. We first convert an RST tree to a format similar to those constituency trees in the Penn Treebank. For\neach binary branching node with a nucleus child and a satellite child, we use the relation as the label\nof the converted parent node. The nucleus/satellite relation, along with the direction (either \u2190or\u2192,\npointing from satellite to nucleus) is then used as the label. After converting an RST tree into the constituency tree format, we then replace each leaf node (i.e.,\nEDU) with the corresponding syntactic (sub)tree from PTB. Given that the sentences in the RST\nTreebank is a subset of that of PTB, we can always find the corresponding constituency subtrees for\neach EDU leaf node. E.g., if C\u2013D is one EDU\nin the PTB tree A it might be converted to Purpose \u2192DCB A based on the Penn Treebank and RST\nTreebank. This PTB-RST treebank is released as a set of tools to generate the joint trees given Penn\nTree- bank and RST Treebank data. During the align- ment between the RST trees and the PTB trees,\nwe only keep the common parts of the two trees. We follow the standard training/testing split of the RST Treebank. In the training set, there are 347\njoint trees with a total of 17,837 tokens, and the lengths of the discourses range from 30 to 2,199\ntokens. In the test set, there are 38 joint trees with a total of 4,819 tokens, and the lengths vary from\n45 to 2,607. 3 Joint Syntacto-Discourse Parsing\nGiven the combined syntacto-discourse treebank, we now propose a joint parser that can perform\nend-to-end discourse segmentation and parsing. 3.2 Joint PTB-RST Treebank\nUsing the conversion strategy described above we build the first joint syntacto-discourse treebank. Notice that in conventional\nincremental parsing, the stack stores the subtrees constructed so far, but in span-based constituency\nparsing, the stack only stores the boundaries of subtrees, which are just a list of indices ...i k j. But different from previous work, after a\nstructural action, we choose to keep the last branching point k, i.e., i k j (mostly for combine, but also\ntrivially for shift). This is because in our parsing mechanism, the dis- course relation between two\nEDUs is actually de- termined after the previous combine action. We need to keep the splitting point\nto clearly find the spans of the two EDUs to determine their relations. This midpoint k disappears\nafter a label ac- tion; therefore we can use the shape of the last span on the stack (whether it contains\nthe split point, i.e., i k j or i j) to determine the par- ity of the step and thus no longer need to carry the\nstep z in the state . This greatly simplifies the pre- processing and post-processing efforts needed. During the decoding time, a document is first passed into a two-layer bi-directional LSTM model,\nthen the outputs at each text position of the two layers of the bi-directional LSTMs are con- catenated\nas the positional features. The spans at each parsing step can be represented as the fea- ture vectors\nat the boundaries. The span features are then passed into fully connected networks with softmax to\ncalculate the likelihood of performing the corresponding action or marking the cor- responding label. We use the \u201ctraining with exploration\u201d strategy and the dynamic oracle mechanism to make sure the\nmodel can handle unseen parsing configurations properly. We randomly choose 30\ndocuments from the training set as the development set. We tune the hyperparameters of the neural model on the development set. To alleviate the overfitting problem\nfor training on the relative small RST Treebank, we use a dropout of 0.5. 3One particular hyperparameter is that we use a value to balance the chances between training\nfollowing the exploration (i.e., the best action cho- sen by the neural model) and following the correct\npath provided by the dynamic oracle. Since our parser essentially performs both constituency parsing task and discourse parsing task. We\nalso evaluate the performances on sentence constituency level and discourse level separately. On the other hand, the majority of the conven- tional discourse parsers are not end-to-end: they rely\non gold EDU segmentations and pre-trained tools like Stanford parsers to generate features. We\nperform an experiment to compare the per- formance of our parser with them given the gold EDU\nsegments (Table 3). Note that our parser predicts solely\nbased on the span features from bi-directionaly LSTM, instead of any explicitly designed syntactic\nfeatures. To our best knowledge, this is the first end-to-end parser for discourse parsing task. 4Our parser achieves the state-of-the-art per- formance in end-to-end parsing, and unlike previ- ous\napproaches, needs little pre-processing effort.",
        "Results and Findings": "But most of them suffer from the following\nlimitations:\n1.pipelined rather than end-to-end: they assume pre-segmented discourse, and worse yet, use\ngold-standard segmentations\n2. not self-contained: they rely on external syntactic parsers and pretrained word vectors;\n3. complicated: they design sophisticated features, including those from parse-trees. 3.Even though it simultaneously performs con- stituency parsing, our parser does not use any\nexplicit syntactic feature, nor does it need any binarization of discourse trees, thanks to the\npowerful span-based framework.4.Empirically, our end-to-end parser outperforms the existing pipelined discourse pars- ing\nefforts. 2.1 Review: RST Discourse Structures\nIn an RST discourse tree, there are two types of branchings. 2.2 Syntacto-Discourse Representation\nIt is widely recognized that lower-level lexical and syntactic information can greatly help determin-\ning both the boundaries of the EDUs (i.e., dis- course segmentation) as well as the semantic relations\nbetween EDUs. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the discourse lengths over the whole dataset, which on\naverage is about 2x of PTB sen- tence length, but longest ones are about 10x the longest lengths in\nthe Treebank. 23.1 Extending Span-based Parsing\nAs mentioned above, the input sequences are sub- stantially longer than PTB parsing, so we choose\nlinear-time parsing, by adapting a popular greedy constituency parser, the span-based constituency\nparser.

        "Abstract": "Optimized Transfer Learning with Equivariant\nPretrained Models\nAbstract\nThis research investigates the mechanisms behind Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt-\ning, a method that enhances language models\u2019 performance on complex reasoning\ntasks by decomposing them into simpler steps. Further research could explore the application of CoT to other model architectures\nand task domains, as well as the development of more sophisticated prompting strategies.",
        "Methodology": "The study focuses on understanding\nhow CoT improves in-context learning of compositional functions, particularly\nmulti-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Our theoretical analysis, supported by extensive empirical evidence, reveals that\nCoT\u2019s efficacy stems from its ability to guide the model towards a more structured\nand interpretable solution space, thereby mitigating the limitations of standard\nin-context learning (ICL). This structured approach allows the model to better\nleverage the information provided in the few-shot examples, resulting in improved\naccuracy and robustness. CoT achieves this enhancement by strategically decomposing complex problems into a sequence\nof simpler, more manageable sub-problems. Our investigation centers on understanding how this\ndecomposition process impacts the model\u2019s learning and reasoning capabilities, particularly within\nthe context of in-context learning (ICL). We focus on compositional functions, using multi-layer\nperceptrons (MLPs) as a representative model architecture, to analyze the effects of CoT on various\naspects of model performance. We hypothesize\nthat by breaking down complex tasks, CoT reduces the number of training examples required to\nachieve a given level of accuracy. This reduction in sample complexity is crucial for efficient training\nand deployment of LLMs, especially when dealing with limited datasets or computationally expensive\ntraining processes. Furthermore, we explore how CoT affects the approximation power of the model,\ninvestigating whether the decomposition process allows the model to learn and represent more\ncomplex functions effectively. Our analysis considers the interplay between the complexity of the\ntarget function, the number of training examples, and the length of the CoT prompts. We investigate whether the structured reasoning facilitated by CoT leads to more efficient\nlearning during pretraining, resulting in models with improved generalization capabilities. Our empirical analysis involves a series of experiments designed to validate these hypotheses. Our theoretical analysis complements the empirical findings, providing a deeper understanding of\nthe mechanisms by which CoT improves LLM performance. We develop a framework that explains\nhow the structured reasoning induced by CoT guides the model towards a more interpretable and\nefficient solution space. This framework helps to clarify why CoT consistently outperforms standard\nICL, particularly on complex tasks requiring multiple reasoning steps. The theoretical insights offer\nvaluable guidance for the design and optimization of CoT prompting strategies, paving the way for\nthe development of more effective and efficient LLM training methods. Our work builds upon this line of research,\nfocusing specifically on the impact of CoT on in-context learning (ICL) of compositional functions,\nparticularly within the context of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). This research aims to fill this gap\nby providing a detailed investigation of CoT\u2019s mechanisms and its implications for efficient LLM\ntraining and deployment. We leverage both theoretical and empirical approaches to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of how CoT facilitates the learning of complex functions. The reduction of sample complexity is a crucial aspect of our investigation. Our\nstudy addresses this by conducting extensive experiments to quantify the impact of CoT on sample\ncomplexity, providing quantitative evidence of its efficiency gains. Furthermore, we explore the\nrelationship between CoT prompt length and model performance, investigating the optimal balance\nbetween detailed intermediate steps and computational efficiency. This analysis contributes to the\ndevelopment of more effective and efficient CoT prompting strategies. Our research also delves into the theoretical underpinnings of CoT\u2019s success. We address this by\ndeveloping a theoretical model that explains how CoT guides the model towards a more structured\nand interpretable solution space, leading to improved generalization capabilities. This framework\nprovides a deeper understanding of why CoT consistently outperforms standard ICL, particularly on\ncomplex tasks requiring multiple reasoning steps. The theoretical insights offer valuable guidance for\nthe design and optimization of CoT prompting strategies. While the benefits of pretraining are well-established [7], the specific role of CoT in en-\nhancing pretraining efficiency and generalization remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates\nwhether the structured reasoning facilitated by CoT leads to more efficient learning during pretraining,\nresulting in models with improved generalization capabilities. We posit that the decomposition\ninherent in CoT allows the model to learn more robust and transferable representations, which are\nless susceptible to overfitting and perform better on unseen data. This aspect is crucial for building\nLLMs that can effectively generalize to a wide range of tasks and domains. While many studies have explored CoT in the context of natural\n2language processing tasks, a detailed analysis of its impact on the learning of compositional functions\nwithin a simpler, more controlled setting like MLPs provides valuable insights into the fundamental\nmechanisms underlying CoT\u2019s effectiveness. 3 Methodology\nThis research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining theoretical analysis with empirical\nexperimentation to investigate the mechanisms behind Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We analyze how this decomposition affects the model\u2019s ability to\nlearn compositional functions, focusing on the impact on sample complexity and approximation\npower. This theoretical analysis involves developing a mathematical model to capture the relationship\nbetween CoT prompt length, function complexity, and model performance. We explore how the\nstructured reasoning induced by CoT guides the model towards a more efficient and interpretable\nsolution space, leading to improved generalization. Our empirical investigation involves a series of experiments designed to validate our theoretical\nhypotheses and quantify the effects of CoT. We use a range of MLP architectures and reasoning tasks\nof varying complexity, systematically varying the number of training examples and the length of the\nCoT prompts. For each experiment, we measure the model\u2019s accuracy and compare the performance\nof CoT prompting against standard ICL. The datasets used in our experiments consist of synthetically generated data designed to represent\ncompositional functions of varying complexity. This allows us to control the complexity of the tasks\nand isolate the effects of CoT from other factors that might influence performance in more complex\nreal-world datasets. The synthetic data is generated using a set of predefined rules, ensuring that the\nfunctions are well-defined and their complexity can be precisely controlled. This approach allows for\na more rigorous and controlled evaluation of CoT\u2019s impact on sample complexity and approximation\npower. We also explore the use of different prompting strategies, varying the level of guidance\nprovided in the CoT prompts and the types of intermediate steps included. We use statistical tests, such as t-tests, to compare\nthe performance of CoT prompting against standard ICL. We inves-\ntigate whether the structured reasoning facilitated by CoT leads to more efficient learning during\npretraining, resulting in models with improved generalization capabilities. This involves comparing\nthe performance of models pretrained with and without CoT on a range of downstream tasks. We\nanalyze the learned representations of the models to understand how CoT influences the model\u2019s\ninternal representations and its ability to generalize to unseen data. This comprehensive approach allows us to gain a deep understanding of CoT\u2019s mechanisms and its\nimplications for efficient and effective LLM training and deployment. We designed experiments to systematically evaluate CoT\u2019s impact on sample\ncomplexity, approximation power, and generalization ability in the context of in-context learning\n(ICL) for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) solving compositional functions. Our experiments involved\nvarying the complexity of the target functions, the number of training examples provided, and the\nlength of the CoT prompts. The\nexperiments were conducted using synthetic datasets to ensure controlled evaluation and precise\nmanipulation of function complexity. We generated datasets with varying levels of noise to assess the\nrobustness of CoT under different conditions. As expected, CoT\nconsistently outperformed ICL, requiring significantly fewer examples to achieve the same level of\naccuracy, particularly for more complex functions. This reduction in sample complexity highlights\nCoT\u2019s efficiency in learning from limited data. Excessively long prompts did not always lead to further\nimprovements, indicating a potential trade-off between detail and computational cost. The table shows that CoT consistently improved the model\u2019s ability to\napproximate complex functions, achieving higher accuracy than ICL across all complexity levels. This suggests that CoT facilitates the learning of more intricate relationships within the data, enabling\nthe model to capture the underlying structure of the compositional functions more effectively. The\nimprovement was particularly pronounced for functions requiring multiple reasoning steps, further\nsupporting the hypothesis that CoT enhances the model\u2019s capacity for compositional reasoning. This enhanced gener-\nalization ability is crucial for deploying models in real-world scenarios where the data distribution\nmay differ from the training data. The improvement in generalization was consistent across different\nfunction complexities and prompt lengths, suggesting that CoT\u2019s benefits extend beyond specific task\ncharacteristics. Further\nanalysis revealed a correlation between the length of the CoT prompt and generalization performance,\nwith longer prompts generally leading to better generalization, up to a certain point beyond which\ndiminishing returns were observed. CoT consistently\nimproved sample complexity, approximation power, and generalization ability, demonstrating its\neffectiveness as a method for improving the efficiency and robustness of in-context learning.",
        "Results and Findings": "We explore the impact of CoT on sample com-\nplexity and approximation power in reasoning tasks, demonstrating a significant\nreduction in the number of examples required for accurate performance.

In summary, this research provides a comprehensive investigation into the efficacy of CoT prompting. We present both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating its significant impact on sample\ncomplexity, approximation power, and generalization capabilities of LLMs. Our findings contribute\nto a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of CoT and offer valuable insights for future\nresearch in the development and application of LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.

The theoretical framework is designed to provide\na principled explanation for the observed empirical results.

We also investigate the relationship\nbetween the theoretical predictions of our model and the empirical results, assessing the validity and\nrobustness of our theoretical framework. The results of this analysis\nprovide insights into the long-term benefits of incorporating CoT into the LLM training pipeline. 34 Experiments\nThis section details the experimental setup and results of our investigation into Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) prompting. We compared the performance of models trained with CoT prompting\nagainst those trained with standard ICL, using accuracy as the primary evaluation metric. We\nemployed rigorous statistical methods to ensure the reliability of our findings. Our first set of experiments focused on sample complexity.

Figure 1: Sample Complexity Comparison: CoT vs. ICL\n[width=0.8]sample complexity plot.pd f\nNext, we investigated CoT\u2019s impact on approximation power. We evaluated the ability of models\ntrained with and without CoT to accurately represent functions of increasing complexity. Table\n1 summarizes the results. We evaluated the performance of models\ntrained with and without CoT on a held-out test set. The results showed that CoT led to significant\nimprovements in generalization performance, indicating that the structured reasoning facilitated by\nCoT promotes the learning of more robust and transferable representations. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that CoT enhances the model\u2019s ability\nto learn generalizable representations, leading to improved performance on unseen data. 4The overall results of our experiments strongly support the hypothesis that CoT prompting signif-\nicantly enhances the performance of MLPs on compositional reasoning tasks. These\nfindings have significant implications for the development and deployment of large language models,\nsuggesting that CoT can be a valuable tool for improving the performance of these models on complex\nreasoning tasks.",

        "Abstract": "Flexible Online Aggregations Using Basis Function Expansions\nAbstract\nBayesian learning often necessitates online inference, adaptive models, and the combination of multiple distinct\nmodels.",
        "Methodology": "Recent advancements have demonstrated the use of random feature approximations for scalable, online\naggregation of Gaussian processes, which possess favorable theoretical characteristics and practical uses. A crucial\naspect of these methods is the incorporation of a random walk on model parameters, which introduces adaptability. We demonstrate that these methods can be readily extended to any model using basis function expansion and that\nemploying alternative basis expansions, such as Hilbert space Gaussian processes, frequently leads to enhanced\nperformance. To streamline the selection of a specific basis expansion, the versatility of our approach also enables\nthe aggregation of several entirely different models, such as a Gaussian process and polynomial regression. Online adaptations of various methods have been developed, including kernel machines,\n(kernel) least-squares, and Gaussian processes. Online learning can be further complicated when model selection is needed, as the best-performing model is rarely evident at the\noutset of the learning process. One solution involves training multiple models concurrently and then combining them. More recently, it was shown how to adapt BMA to online Gaussian processes (GPs) in a technique called incremental ensembles\nof GPs. GPs are a versatile, non-parametric instrument in Bayesian machine learning that possesses universal approximation\ncapabilities and provides well-founded uncertainty estimations. By employing a random Fourier feature (RFF) approximation for\nGaussian processes, online learning can be executed, featuring closed-form Bayesian model averaging updates and a manageable\nregret analysis. Besides an online ensemble of GPs, the advantages of incorporating random walks on model parameters were illustrated, which they\nterm dynamic IE-GPs (DIE-GPs). This can significantly enhance performance when the learning task undergoes slight changes over\ntime. Extensions\nto this framework encompass Gaussian process state-space models, deep Gaussian processes, and graph learning. Along with its\nextensions, DIE-GPs have been effectively applied in Bayesian optimization and causal inference. However, the dependence on the RFF approximation implies that IE-GPs also inherit the limitations of random feature GPs. 3 Methodology\nIn this paper, we present online ensembles of basis expansions (OEBEs), a generalization of IE-GPs that overcomes their dependence\non RFF GPs and enhances performance across multiple real datasets. Our specific contributions are as follows:1. The same derivations and code can be reused to combine arbitrary Bayesian linear models with any design matrix. This allows for the combination of not only models of the same type but also various distinct basis expansions (e.g., B-splines,\none-layer RBF networks, etc.). We contend that a GP with a generalized additive model (GAM) structure is often more\nsuitable when GP regression is the focus. To this end, we employ GAM Hilbert space Gaussian processes (HSGPs), which can\nbe interpreted as a quadrature rule for the same integral that the RFF approximation addresses through direct Monte Carlo. We introduce a new method for\nintegrating static and dynamic models, enabling the use of principled posteriors of static methods when appropriate and extending\nthe expressiveness of dynamic methods otherwise. We provide Jax/Objax code\nathttps://www.github.com/danwaxman/DynamicOnlineBasisExpansions that only requires the user to specify the design\nmatrix, with several choices already implemented. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews foundational concepts in linear basis expansions, GP regression,\nspectral approximations of GPs, and BMA. The proposed models are empirically evaluated in Section 5. The metrics we employ are the normalized mean square error (nMSE) and the predictive log-likelihood (PLL). CaData comprises California housing data,\nand the task of CPU Small is to predict a type of CPU usage based on system properties. All hyperparameter optimization was performed on the first 1,000 samples of each dataset; since we already assume access, each\ndataset was additionally standardized in both x and y using the statistics of the first 1,000 samples. We follow prior work in setting a\nweight to 0 when it falls below the threshold of 10-16. Furthermore, we examine both static and dynamic versions of models to assess their performance. Apart from additional hyperparameter tuning in an ARD kernel, the (D)OE-RFF model is identical to the (D)IE-GP. An SE-ARD kernel was utilized in both cases. For RBF networks, 100 locations were\ninitialized using K-means and subsequently optimized with empirical Bayes, along with ARD length scales. The initial values of \u02d803c32\u02d803b8 and \u02d803c32\u02d803f5 were 1.0 and 0.25, respectively. This reinforces the notion that combining several different models is advantageous, as\nno single method consistently outperforms the others. Moreover, as anticipated, dynamic models can substantially outperform static models in specific scenarios (e.g., on SARCOS and\nKuka 1) but yield a lower PLL on datasets where the data is reasonably i.i.d. However, it is also occasionally outperformed\nby simpler methods, such as the RBF network, highlighting the potential advantages of employing diverse basis expansions. While this premature collapse of BMA weights does not appear to be common in real datasets, it is not difficult to\nillustrate its possibility, even on real datasets with high-performing methods. Specifically, we created an ensemble of two additive HSGPs, with the first model being dynamic\n(\u02d803c3(1)rw2= 10-3) and the second model being static ( \u02d803c3(2) = 0). The ensemble hyperparameters were determined using\nempirical Bayes, with initial length scale values set to the vector of ones. Subsequently, the resulting ensemble was trained online as\na DOEBE and as an E-DOEBE, with \u02d803b4 = 10-2. Numerically, the log-likelihood of the\nE-DOEBE model is dramatically better than that of the DOEBE model (Table 2), showing this collapse can be catastrophic. This issue can be partially averted by eliminating the threshold of 10-16when ensembling. Indeed, in this example, the weights\nreach a minimum of approximately 10-72. To do so, we repeat\nthe experiments of Section 5.1 while comparing to an E-DOEBE model. We restrict our attention to static and dynamic versions of\nthe three best-performing families of models in Experiment 1 ((D)OE-HSGP, (D)OE-RFF, and (D)OE-RBF), and an E-DOEBE\nensemble containing all of them. As desired, the E-DOEBE model can effectively ensemble dynamic and static models of different basis expansions. This included several basis expansions that surpass RFF GPs on real and synthetic datasets. We show how different\nlinear basis expansions can be combined within a simple framework, enhancing ensemble diversity. While several common choices\nof basis expansions were employed, it would be worthwhile to expand the tests even further, particularly with splines. Further research could explore the\nincorporation of other Bayesian combining methods, such as Bayesian (hierarchical) stacking. While we provide guidance on initializing ensembles given a set of basis expansions, determining which basis expansions to use is\nan important open topic. A naive approach would be to expand on the existing use of the marginal likelihood for model selection,\nbut this may be \"unsafe\" when using different basis expansions and therefore requires caution. Indeed, recent progress in GPs has worked\ntowards selecting and adapting kernels online to great benefit. If such techniques could be adapted to DOEBE, it could eliminate the\npre-training period and allow for adapting the domain of approximations when new data arrives. In addition to the\noriginal sources above, several of these datasets were curated by the UCI Machine Learning Repository or LibSVM.

        "Results and Findings": "In a Bayesian\nframework, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) has long been employed to combine online models, functioning by assigning weights\nto each \"expert\" model based on its supporting evidence. Our findings reveal that on several real-world datasets, (D)IE-GPs exhibit performance that\nis comparable to or worse than that of simpler models, such as online Bayesian linear regression and one-layer RBF networks. Apart\nfrom theoretical considerations, empirical evidence indicates that HSGPs converge to the true approximated GP more rapidly (in\nterms of the number of basis functions) than RFF GPs. We offer a similar empirical evaluation. We demonstrate the necessity of this method by providing a constructive example\non real data where the naive approach to combining static and dynamic methods is unsuccessful. In the first experiment\n(Section 5.1), we assess ensembles of several different basis expansions, demonstrating that the best-performing model varies\nconsiderably. The nMSE is defined\nas the MSE of yt with the predictive mean, divided by the variance of y1:T. Specifically, at time t, the nMSE is calculated as:\nnMSE t=Pt\n\u03c4=1(\u00b5y\u03c4\u2212y\u03c4)2\nt\u00b7V ar(y1:T)\nThe predictive log-likelihood (PLL) is the average value of log p(yt+1|X1:t, y1:t), i.e.,\nPLL t=Pt\n\u03c4=1logp(y\u03c4+1|X1:\u03c4,y1:\u03c4)\nt.\nAcross all experiments, we utilize several publicly available datasets, varying in both size and the number of features. For dynamic models, \u02d803c32was set to 10-3. 2Results of the average nMSE and PLL are presented in Table 2 and Table 3. We observe that the best-performing class of models\nvaries significantly across datasets. Specifically, in terms of both nMSE and PLL, HSGPs, RFF GPs, and RBF networks each achieve\nthe best performance on at least one dataset. As expected, when an additive structure is a reasonable approximation, additive HSGP methods surpass RFF GPs, for instance, on\nKuka 1 and CaData. Key Takeaways Key takeaways from this experiment include: (1) neither dynamic nor static methods are strictly superior across all\nsettings, (2) no single basis expansion is superior across all datasets, and (3) RFF GPs consistently provide good performance, but\nthis performance can often be improved upon by using other basis expansions. 4.2 The Necessity of Ensembles of Dynamic Ensembles\nIn this experiment, we demonstrate that the E-DOEBE model introduced in Section 4.2 can indeed prevent the premature collapse of\nBMA weights. Note that in this carefully controlled setting, each basis expansion is entirely\ndeterministic given the hyperparameters, so the results are purely deterministic and cannot be attributed to poor random seeds. The resulting weights demonstrate that premature collapse of BMA weights can be a problem. Across all\nexperiments, the E-DOEBE model performs the best in terms of PLL, and is the best in terms of NMSE for all but one dataset\n(Friedman 2). Key Takeaway The E-DOEBE can effectively ensemble several different ensembles of high-performing basis expansions, resulting\nin consistently better performance than any single method. We also demonstrated that the premature collapse of BMA weights can be a concern in online combining.

        "Abstract": "Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems:\nMaximizing Sample Efficiency and Minimizing Variance\nAbstract\nOptimizing long-term user satisfaction in recommender systems, such as news feeds, is crucial during continuous\nuser-system interactions. \u2022MBCAL (w/o variance reduction): An ablated version of MBCAL where we use SFR instead of CFA as the label for FAM.",
        "Methodology": "However,\npractical hurdles like low sample efficiency, potential risks, and high variance hinder the implementation of deep\nreinforcement learning in online systems. MBCAL leverages the unique aspects of\nrecommender systems and incorporates concepts from model-based reinforcement learning to enhance sample\nefficiency. It consists of two main parts: an environment model that predicts immediate user behavior sequentially\nand a future advantage model that forecasts future utility. Counterfactual comparisons from the environment model\nare used to mitigate the excessive variance when training the future advantage model. Consequently, MBCAL\nachieves high sample efficiency and significantly reduced variance, while utilizing existing user logs to avoid\nstarting from scratch. Despite its capabilities, MBCAL maintains a relatively low implementation cost, making it\nsuitable for real-world systems. The proposed method surpasses other supervised learning and RL-based methods\nin both sample efficiency and overall performance, as demonstrated through theoretical analysis and extensive\nexperiments. The content\nrecommended in past interactions can influence future user behavior. Deep RL models\nuser-system interactions as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Many studies in this field focus on model-free reinforcement\nlearning (MFRL) methods. On-policy RL struggles to\nutilize off-policy user logs, leading to difficulties in online infrastructure and initial performance. Conversely, off-policy RL faces\nthe risk of non-convergence when combined with function approximation and offline training. MBRL employs\nan environment model to predict immediate feedback and state transitions, along with a planning module to find an optimal\ntrajectory. Planning is often infeasible in multi-stage retrieval\nframeworks commonly used in modern recommender systems. These systems generate candidate sets of items in earlier stages for\nsubsequent stages, making it impossible to predetermine candidates. However, this faster convergence comes at the cost of reduced asymptotic performance due to error accumulation from\nvirtual interactions. Another significant challenge in deploying RL is the excessive variance of gradients during optimization. Longer horizons tend to exacerbate the variance, significantly\nslowing down convergence and introducing instability. However, these proposals primarily target MFRL, and variance reduction in\nMBRL remains largely unexplored. Some\nusers may be more inclined to provide positive or negative feedback than others. Even individual users may exhibit differentbehaviors at different times of the day. While a large amount of data can mitigate the impact of variance, it still negatively affects performance due to\ndata sparsity for specific users and items. To address variance reduction, our work introduces the concept of comparing an observed trajectory with a counterfactual trajectory. This counterfactual trajectory shares all contexts with the original, including the user, historical interactions, and follow-up items,\nexcept for the current action being replaced. By comparing these trajectories, we can make more informed judgments about the\nadvantage of taking a specific action. MBCAL decomposes overall utility into immediate utility (rewards from the current step) and future utility\n(rewards from future steps). The environment model naturally predicts immediate utility, while future utility is approximated through\nsimulated rollout. To further reduce variance in future utilities, we perform two comparative simulated rollouts. We then\ncalculate the counterfactual future advantage (CFA) as the difference in future utility with and without masking. 2 Methodology\nThe core concept of MBCAL is illustrated by employing two models: the Masked Environment Model (MEM) and the Future\nAdvantage Model (FAM). These models are designed to estimate immediate user behavior and future advantages, respectively. The\ntraining process begins with optimizing the environment model to predict user behaviors, incorporating a masking item into the\nmodel. Using the MEM, we compute the Counterfactual Future Advantage (CFA) by contrasting the future utility derived from\nmasking the action against not masking it. The CFA then serves as the target for training the FAM. During inference, we combine\nboth models to select actions. We first formalize the environment model and then detail the MEM, FAM, and the overall learning process. Following this, we\nprovide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Here, we use approximations for the transition\nprobability and the reward function. Specifically, to formulate the environment model in a recommender system context, we can\nexpress the transition probability as the probability of observing the next user behavior given the past trajectory and the current\naction. This means that predicting the transition simplifies to predicting the immediate user behavior. Since the reward also depends\nsolely on user behavior, a single model can replace the separate transition and reward approximations. We introduce a function with\ntrainable parameters to approximate the probability of the next user behavior. The transition and reward are then approximated using\nthis function. This allows us to create a\ncounterfactual comparison to the current trajectory, answering the question: \"What would the future behavior be if this action were\nnot taken?\" We introduce a virtual item represented by a trainable embedding vector. Given an observation trajectory, we denote the\ntrajectory where actions at specific positions are replaced by this virtual item as a masked trajectory. We sample random positions for each trajectory, replacing each position with a uniform probability. The\nMEM aims to recover the user behavior as closely as possible when some items are masked. Using the collected masked trajectories,\nwe maximize the likelihood or minimize the negative log-likelihood (NLL). To model sequential observations, the MEM\u2019s architecture follows that of session-based recurrent recommender systems. We use a\nGated Neural Network to encode the trajectory. Since we need to encode both the trajectory and the current action, we concatenate\nthe input in a staggered manner. For each step, the model takes the previous behavior and the current action as input and outputs the\nprobability of the next possible behavior. An additional start symbol is introduced as the beginning of the observed user behavior. Given a trained MEM, we first define the\nSimulated Future Reward (SFR) for an observed trajectory at a specific time step. We then calculate the CFA by subtracting the SFR\nof the counterfactual comparison from the original one. Finally, we introduce the Future Advantage Model (FAM), with its own set\nof trainable parameters, to approximate this CFA. To train the FAM, we minimize the mean square error. Instead of predicting\na distribution, the FAM\u2019s last layer predicts a scalar value representing the advantage. 2.4 Summary of MBCAL\nFor inference, we select the item (action) based on both the MEM and FAM. Formally, given user information and the observation\ntrajectory, we choose the next action by maximizing the sum of the immediate reward predicted by the MEM and the future advantage\npredicted by the FAM. To avoid local optima in policy improvement, we use an \u03b5-greedy strategy. With probability \u03b5, we select a\nrandom action; otherwise, we select the action that maximizes the combined reward and advantage. MBCAL aligns well with the Growing Batch-RL settings. The algorithm involves iterative data collection and policy updates. The variance reduction in MBCAL is primarily achieved through the subtraction in the CFA calculation, which eliminates noise\nfrom user feedback and other sources. While we borrow ideas from the advantage function concept, our CFA differs in that we do\nnot resample the trajectory but keep the remaining part unchanged. Additionally, since the FAM averages the CFA across different trajectories, the bias becomes negligible compared to\nthe benefits of variance reduction. To thoroughly assess the performance of the proposed systems, we\nfollow previous works and construct simulators. However, instead of synthetic simulators, we use real-data-driven simulators. User behavior corresponds to star ratings, with\nrewards matching these ratings. We focus on predicting the dwelling\ntime on clicked news, partitioned into 12 levels, each corresponding to a different user behavior. First, all agents are restricted to using only a subset of features, while the simulator\nuses the full feature set. Second, we intentionally set the model architecture of the simulator to\ndiffer from that of the agents. To gauge the simulator\u2019s accuracy, we report micro-F1, weighted-F1, and RMSE for user behavior classification. 33.2.1 Evaluation Settings\nThe evaluation process consists of two types of iterations: training rounds and test rounds. During a training round, the agent\ngenerates actions using an \u03b5-greedy policy ( \u03b5= 0.1 for all experiments) and updates its policy based on feedback from the simulator. In the test round, the agent uses a greedy policy, and the generated data is not used for training. Each session in both training and test\nrounds involves 20 steps of interaction between the simulator and the agent. Each round includes 256,000 sessions. For each experiment, we report the average reward per session in the test round, calculated as the sum of rewards over all sessions in\nthe test round divided by the number of sessions. We simulate both Batch RL and Growing Batch-RL evaluations separately. In Batch RL\nevaluation, the agent trains only on static user logs and interacts with the simulator during testing. 3.3 Methods for Comparison\nWe compare various methods, including Supervised Learning (GRU4Rec), bandits (GRU4Rec ( \u03b5-greedy)), MFRL (MCPE, DQN,\nDDQN, and DDPG), and MBRL (Dyna-Q). Therefore, we use the \u03b5-greedy version of NN models (GRU4Rec\n(\u03b5-greedy)) instead of LinUCB. We use entropy loss in GRU4Rec. \u2022 GRU4Rec ( \u03b5-greedy): Applies \u03b5-greedy item selection in GRU4Rec during training rounds. We use GRU for state representation to ensure fair comparison, similar to\nGRU4Rec and our method. \u2022DDQN: Double DQN, which uses a different action selection for value backup to avoid value overestimation in off-policy\nlearning. The inferred\naction selects the nearest neighbor item for display. We use the same neural structure as GRU4Rec for both actor and critic\nnetworks. The model architecture is the same as other baselines. \u2022Dyna-Q: An MBRL method that augments DQN with imagined rollouts from an environment model. The ratio of imagined\nrollouts to real trajectories is 1:1. \u2022 MBCAL: The full version of our proposed method. All parameters are optimized using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10-3,\u03b21= 0.9, and \u03b22= 0.999. The discount factor for\nlong-term rewards is \u03b3= 0.95. Embedding sizes for item-id and other id-type features are set to 32. The hidden size for MLP is 32. For training MEM in MBCAL, we use p mask= 0.20 to generate masked trajectories. We evaluate the reward per session based on the rewards generated\nby the simulator. Upon closer examination of the value functions in DDPG, we observed significant overestimation compared\nto other MFRL methods. This overestimation likely arises from value backups based on continuous actions that may not correspond\nto actual items. However, the\nadvantage of our method over the supervised learning method is less pronounced in the MovieLens and Netflix datasets compared to\nNewsFeed. Furthermore, while learning to predict long-term utility requires more data than immediate rewards, the dominance of RL is not\nyet fully apparent in Batch-RL settings. Nevertheless, it is crucial that MBCAL\u2019s initial performance is already state-of-the-art,\nunderscoring its low risk and high sample efficiency. 4Table 1: Average reward per session of different algorithms and datasets in Batch-RL evaluation. This observation aligns with expectations since the virtual experience loses its benefits as sufficient real user feedback accumulates. MCPE, DQN, DDQN, and Dyna-Q lag behind other methods, including supervised learning baselines in MovieLens and Netflix, but\nnot in NewsFeed. Investigating further, we modified GRU4Rec to output the immediate reward instead of user behavior classification,\nturning the task into regression and replacing entropy loss with mean square error loss. This change resulted in a significant\nperformance drop in GRU4Rec, aligning more closely with the NewsFeed results. 3.4.3 Analysis of the variance\nThe critical aspect of MBCAL is variance reduction through counterfactual comparisons. Previous research indicates that the\nmean square error (MSE) in a well-trained model comprises model bias and label variance (noise). Since we use equivalent neural\narchitectures across all comparison methods, they share the same model bias. To\nassess whether CFA effectively reduces variance, we compare the MSE from the value backup equation and the CFA equation. We\nanalyze the MSE of MCPE, DQN, Dyna-Q, MBCAL (w/o variance reduction), and MBCAL using interactive logs from the test\nround of Batch-RL evaluation. Consistent with theoretical analysis, longer horizon value backups exhibit higher variance. MCPE has a higher variance than DQN and Dyna-Q due to using the entire trajectory for backup. MBCAL (w/o variance reduction)\nhas the second-largest variance, lower than MCPE because the environment model\u2019s simulated rollout partially eliminates noise. DQN and Dyna-Q have smaller variances due to one-step value backup. To maximize long-term utility,\nwe propose a sample-efficient and variance-reduced reinforcement learning method called MBCAL. This method incorporates a\nmasked environment model to capture immediate user behavior and a future advantage model to predict future utility. By employing\ncounterfactual comparisons, MBCAL significantly reduces learning variance.",
        "Results and Findings": "Reinforcement learning has shown promise in addressing this challenge. Modern recommender systems, like news feeds, must consider multiple user-system interactions within a single session. For example, exploring new topics might pique a user\u2019s interest\nin related areas, while repeatedly showing similar content could lead to a rapid decline in user engagement. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) has gained attention for its potential in recommender systems. Prior research has shown that using an advantage function instead of a value\nfunction can reduce variance and improve performance. We conducted experiments using three real-world datasets and compared our method with supervised learning, MFRL, and MBRL\napproaches. We implement\ntwo specific settings in the evaluation process. For the NewsFeed dataset, we also analyzed over 400 historical A-B test records. The correlation between our simulator\u2019s predictions of long-term rewards (e.g., total clicks or session dwelling time) and the actual\noutcomes is above 0.90.

        "Abstract": "Controlling False Discovery Rates in Detecting Heterogeneous\nTreatment Effects for Online Experiments\nAbstract\nOnline controlled experiments, commonly referred to as A/B testing, are widely used in many Internet companies\nfor data-driven decision-making regarding feature modifications and product releases. Let\nYi(Ti)represent the potential outcome for the i-th user, where Ti= 1if the i-th user is in the treatment group and Ti= 0if the i-th\nuser is in the control group. It is important to note that the ATE is\nnot directly observable since Yi(0)andYi(1)cannot be known simultaneously. For instance, if the covariate is \u2019country\u2019, the covariate space can be partitioned into countries, and \u03c4(x)represents the conditional\naverage treatment effect for users in country x. If\u03c4(x)is statistically different from the average treatment effect \u00af\u03c4, then country xis\nconsidered heterogeneous. We will refer to this method as the \"naive approach\". This naive approach is simple and may appear intuitive to non-statisticians. For simplicity, we treat the estimated\nATE as a parameter. Suppose the response of interest, y, follows the classical linear model:\ny=X\u03b2+\u03f5, where y\u2208Rnis a vector of y, X\u2208Rn\u00d7pis any fixed design matrix, \u03b2is a vector of unknown coefficients, and\n\u03f5\u223cN(0, \u03c32I)is Gaussian error.",
        "Methodology": "However, a significant\nchallenge remains in methodically evaluating how each code or feature change affects millions of users who\nexhibit considerable heterogeneity across various dimensions such as countries, ages, and devices. This paper\nintroduces statistical techniques designed to systematically and precisely pinpoint the Heterogeneous Treatment\nEffect (HTE) within any specific user cohort, like mobile device type or country. Additionally, these methods help\ndetermine which user factors, such as age or gender, contribute to the variability in treatment effects observed\nduring an A/B test. Through the application of these methods to both simulated and real-world experimental\ndata, we demonstrate their robust performance in maintaining a controlled, low False Discovery Rate (FDR). Simultaneously, they offer valuable insights into the heterogeneity of identified user groups. We have implemented\na toolkit based on these methods and utilized it to assess the HTE across numerous A/B tests at Snap. 1 Introduction\nControlled experiments, also known as A/B testing, have become a standard method for assessing and enhancing new product\nconcepts across internet companies. Numerous IT companies, possessing extensive and large-scale data, have developed internal\nA/B testing platforms to address their intricate experimentation requirements. The in-house platform currently manages hundreds of concurrent experiments at any moment. As experimentation gains popularity, there is an increasing demand for experimenters to understand not only the overall impact\non metrics in an A/B test but also the reasons behind metric changes and the specific user segments driving these changes. Such\ninsights into user heterogeneity can assist experimenters in devising strategies to enhance the product. Indeed, we\nhave encountered numerous instances where users react differently to the same experimental treatment. Given the hundreds of thousands of user characteristics available to internet companies, user groups can be\nformed in millions of different ways. The objective of our work is to bridge this gap by offering rigorous statistical methods and a toolkit capable of detecting Heterogeneous\nTreatment Effects (HTE) while addressing the potential issue of multiple testing by controlling the false positive rate (FDR). In this paper, we explore the rationale for using FDR and contrast two statistical\nmethods that manage FDR, using both simulated results and actual experimental data. Based on the methods selected, we will\ndiscuss solutions to two questions that experimenters and practitioners are keen to understand regarding HTE:\n\u2022How to systematically identify which subgroups of users (e.g., countries) exhibit treatment effects significantly different\nfrom the Average Treatment Effect in an A/B test. \u2022How to rigorously determine which factors (e.g., age, gender) contribute to the heterogeneity of the treatment effect in an\nA/B test. Our contributions in this paper are summarized as follows:\u2022We frame the HTE detection problem as an FDR control issue and elaborate on why controlling FDR is crucial in large-scale\nHTE detection in practical applications. \u2022We employ two methods capable of controlling FDR in our HTE detection process and provide insightful comparisons of\nthese methods using both simulation and real-world empirical data. \u2022We discuss two significant lessons learned, concerning (1) the distinction between heterogeneity in the population and\nheterogeneity in treatment effects, and (2) the scalability of the algorithms. These insights are intended to help practitioners\navoid similar pitfalls. 2 Methodology\n2.1 Average Treatment Effect vs. Heterogeneous Treatment Effect\nIn an A/B test, users are randomly divided into a treatment group and a control group, and the metrics of interest are observed\nfor all users. Consequently, \u03c4i=Yi(1)\u2212Yi(0)denotes the causal effect of the treatment for the i-th unit, and the\naverage causal effect across all users, \u00af\u03c4, is defined as the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). However, the estimator Yi|Ti= 1\u2212Yi|Ti= 0is unbiased for the ATE when two specific assumptions are met\nand is commonly used to estimate the ATE in A/B testing. \u2022 The treatment applied to one user does not affect the outcome of another user (no interference). Unconfoundedness: Tiis independent of (Yi(0), Yi(1)) given Xi, where Xiis a set of pre-treatment variables for the\ni-th user, such as age, gender, country, etc. To investigate heterogeneous treatment effects, it is necessary to consider the conditional average\ntreatment effect, defined as: \u03c4(x) =E[Yi(1)\u2212Yi(0)|Xi=x], where Xirepresents a set of pre-treatment variables for the i-th user. Accurately estimating the conditional average treatment effect \u03c4(x)for all values of xis highly beneficial for detecting heterogeneous\ntreatment effects because \u03c4(x)provides the conditional average treatment effect for the subpopulation defined by the covariates x. There is a growing need for rigorous analysis based on heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE), which motivates us to develop a\nrobust statistical approach for HTE detection. 2.2 Naive Approaches and their Caveats\nIn this section, we outline some prevalent practices used by practitioners that could result in the spurious discovery of HTE. Suppose\nwe have users from various countries and wish to identify which countries exhibit treatment effects different from the ATE for a\nparticular metric. A straightforward approach to detect heterogeneous countries involves first conducting a two-sample t-test on the\nobservations from each country to obtain a two-sided p-value for each country, and then selecting countries with a p-value less than\n0.05 as the result. However, it is susceptible to the multiple testing problem. \u2022 Step 2: Implement the naive approach and identify subgroups with p-values below 0.05 as heterogeneous. The Bonferroni correction method can be employed to address the multiple testing problem by controlling the family-wise error rate\n(FWER). The FWER is the probability of rejecting at least one true hypothesis. Nevertheless, the Bonferroni method is known to be\n2highly conservative, resulting in a high rate of false negatives and low statistical power, defined as P(reject H0|H1), where H0is\nthe null hypothesis and H1is the alternative hypothesis. 2.3 False Discovery Rate Controlled HTE Detection\nDue to the limitations of the methods discussed in the previous section, we introduce methods for HTE detection that address\nthe multiple testing problem while maintaining sufficient statistical power. False Discovery Rate: Let Q be the proportion of false positives among all detected (rejections of the null hypothesis). Additionally, methods that control\nthe FDR are generally much less conservative than the Bonferroni method. 2.4 Detection for Heterogeneous Subgroups\nWhen conducting an A/B testing experiment, it is often important to identify which subgroups of users exhibit treatment effects\ndifferent from the ATE. For example, at Snap, with users from over 200 countries, we are interested in determining which countries\nhave higher or lower treatment effects compared to the average for the metric of interest. To achieve this, we utilize the Benjamini-\nHochberg (BH) procedure to control the FDR. The BH procedure is known to control the FDR if the test statistics are independent or\nsatisfy the positive regression dependence on a subset property. It is one of the most widely used FDR control methods due to its\nsimplicity. For instance, suppose we have p-values from m independent hypothesis tests H1, ..., H mranked in ascending order:\np(1), ..., p (m), and we aim to control the FDR at level q. By doing so, it theoretically ensures that the FDR is controlled below q. To detect heterogeneous subgroups, it is necessary to estimate the conditional average treatment effects defined in equation (3) for\nthe subgroups. Although individual treatment effect values are not available due to the fundamental problem of causal inference, we\ncan construct a transformed outcome (TO) for each user as an alternative measure of individual treatment effect. Let Yobs\nibe the\nobserved outcome for the i-th unit. Additionally, let p be the assignment probability, which, in practice, is the traffic percentage\nassigned to the treatment group in an A/B test. We propose the following method, which combines the BH method and Transformed Outcome, to detect heterogeneous subgroups. Suppose we have n users from p subgroups, and we want to identify subgroups with heterogeneous treatment effects that differ from\nthe average treatment effect with a controlled FDR. We propose the following procedure, which we call the HTE-BH method:\n\u2022 Step 1: Create an n\u00d7pdesign matrix X such that Xi,j= 1if the i-th user belongs to the j-th subgroup. \u2022Step 2: Compute the transformed outcomes Y\u2217for all users based on the formula in Equation (5), and then subtract the\nestimated ATE, \u00afY(1)\u2212\u00afY(0), from all transformed outcomes. \u2022Step 3: Perform a linear regression using Y as the response and X as the design matrix, and obtain the p-values for the\ncoefficient estimates corresponding to all subgroups. \u2022 Step 4: Apply the BH procedure to the p-values to finalize the list of selected heterogeneous subgroups. The design matrix X created in Step 1 is orthogonal in this scenario, so the p-values derived from the linear regression are independent. Consequently, the BH procedure can control the FDR at a pre-specified level q. In Step 2, we subtract the estimated ATE from the\ntransformed outcomes to detect subgroups with treatment effects different from the ATE. Note that obtaining p-values in the manner described in Step 3 is equivalent to obtaining\np-values from running independent t-tests for all subgroups. 2.5 Detection for Heterogeneous Factors\nIn addition to detecting heterogeneous subgroups, identifying the factors that contribute to the heterogeneity of treatment effects is\nanother crucial task in practice. 3Often, when presented with subtle experimental results, we are unsure which of these factors to investigate further. By pinpointing\nthe factors contributing to the heterogeneity in treatment effects, we can more effectively delve into the relevant factors and derive\ninsights. The HTE-BH method is straightforward and easy to implement for detecting heterogeneous subgroups but is not suitable\nfor detecting heterogeneous factors because, in this case, we cannot construct an orthogonal design matrix in Step 1 of the HTE-BH\nmethod. Therefore, we propose using the \u2019Knockoff\u2019 method to control the FDR for heterogeneous factors. Note that n is the number of observations and p is the number of variables. Let\u03a3 =XTXafter normalizing X. The \u2019Knockoff\u2019 procedure can be summarized in three steps:\n\u2022Step 1: Construct a \u2019knockoff\u2019 matrix \u02dcXof X such that \u02dcXsatisfies: \u02dcXT\u02dcX=XTX= \u03a3,XT\u02dcX= \u03a3\u2212diags , where s is\na non-negative vector that we will construct. \u2022Step 2: Compute a statistic Wjfor each pair (Xj,\u02dcXj)such that a large positive value of Wjprovides evidence against the\nnull hypothesis that the j-th variable is not included in the true model. \u2022Step 3: Calculate a data-dependent threshold T such that the FDR of the knockoff selection set \u02c6S:={j:Wj\u2265T}is less\nthan or equal to the pre-specified level q. In our proposal, we use the equi-correlated method to obtain the non-negative vector s used in Step 1 to construct the knockoff\nmatrix \u02dcX. The equi-correlated method suggests using sj=min{2\u03bbmin(\u03a3),1}for all j, where \u03bbminis the smallest eigenvalue of\n\u03a3. After obtaining this s, we construct \u02dcXusing the formula: \u02dcX=X(I\u2212\u03a3\u22121diags ) +\u02dcUC, where \u02dcUis an n\u00d7porthonormal\nmatrix satisfying \u02dcUTX= 0, and C is a Cholesky decomposition satisfying CTC= 2diags\u2212diags \u03a3\u22121diags . We choose to use Lasso to compute the statistics\nWj\u2019s. Note that (Zj, Zj+p)is a pair corresponding to the j-th original variable and its knockoff. We then calculate Wjas:\nWj= (Zj\u2212Zj+p)\u00d7sign(Zj\u2212Zj+p), forj= 1, ..., p . Let W be the set {|W1|, ...,|Wp|} \\ { 0}. In Step 3, it is proposed to use the threshold: T=min{t\u2208W:1+#{j:Wj\u2264\u2212t}\n#{j:Wj\u2265t}\u2264q}. Theorem 2 claims that the knockoff selection set \u02c6S:={j:Wj\u2265T}is theoretically guaranteed to have an FDR less than q. We propose the following procedure to detect the variables that contribute to the heterogeneity in treatment effects while controlling\nthe FDR. We call this the HTE-Knockoff method:\n\u2022 Step 1: Construct a design matrix X based on the set of pre-treatment variables. \u2022Step 2: Calculate the transformed outcomes Y\u2217for all users based on the formula in Equation (5), and then subtract the\nestimated ATE, \u00afY(1)\u2212\u00afY(0), from all transformed outcomes. \u2022 Step 3: Create a knockoff matrix \u02dcXof X. \u2022 Step 4: Run a Lasso regression using Y as the response and X\u2217= [X\u02dcX]as the design matrix. \u2022 Step 5: Follow the procedure of the Knockoff method to obtain the knockoff selection set of heterogeneous variables. Note that our proposed HTE-Knockoff method can also detect heterogeneous subgroups because it works for any full-rank design\nmatrix, regardless of orthogonality. Additionally, the HTE-Knockoff method is applicable when Xiis a set of variables including\nboth categorical and continuous variables, but we need to be careful in constructing the design matrix when there are more than one\ncategorical variables in Xi. If we were to use the naive approach, it would select many more subgroups,\nclearly indicating numerous false positives. In the second experiment, the HTE-BH method selects one subgroup as heterogeneous, whereas the HTE-Knockoff method selects\nnone. This likely represents a scenario where the true treatment effects are too small to be detected, causing the HTE-Knockoff\n4method to be more conservative than the HTE-BH method to avoid making any false positives. While the\nHTE-BH method is easier to implement, the HTE-Knockoff method has a broader application as it can also be used to detect\nheterogeneous factors. Our proposed methods demonstrate good detection power while addressing the multiple testing problem by\ncontrolling the FDR level. Despite their wide application scenarios, our current methods have some limitations and could be improved in future research. The\nfirst limitation is the assumption that the true model is a linear regression model with Gaussian error; the theoretical properties\nof the original Knockoff method are based on this assumption. Additionally, the\ntrue relationship between the treatment effect and the variables may not always be linear, making the use of linear regression\ninappropriate. Recently, a model-free knockoff method has been proposed, which, under certain conditions, can work on any kind of\nnon-linear model. We attempted to use the transformed design matrix to conduct HTE detection on multiple\nexperiments, but this resulted in increased computational complexity. This problem warrants further investigation because most\ncompanies have a large number of A/B test results available, and it is not feasible to apply the HTE detection method to each\nexperiment individually.",
        "Results and Findings": "Each\nexperiment automatically generates results for hundreds to thousands of varied online metrics. For instance, in a recent\nexperiment, we observed that a decline in a metric was primarily influenced by users with the highest number of snap views. Consequently, we were able to pinpoint a significant performance problem that was causing the metric to drop. In this simulation, 3 out of 30 subgroups are identified as having heterogeneous treatment effects, despite the ATE estimator being 0,\nindicating no actual heterogeneity among the subgroups. Then FDR =E[Q]. To control the FDR, it is necessary to manage the expected proportion of discoveries that are false. Therefore, in our proposed HTE detection approach, we\ncan control the FDR and ensure adequate power simultaneously. In this process, it is crucial to minimize the number of false discoveries in our results. The BH procedure identifies the largest k such that p(k)\u2264k\nmqand rejects\nthe null hypothesis for all H(i)where i\u2264k. The transformed outcome for the i-th unit, Y\u2217\ni, is then defined as:\nY\u2217\ni=Yobs\ni\u00d7(Ti\u2212p)\np(1\u2212p). Let Y be the vector of the resulting outcomes. At Snap, we have anonymously constructed hundreds of user properties, including demographic\ninformation such as age and gender, as well as user engagement levels, such as how users interact with snaps, stories, or discover. Let Y be the vector of the resulting outcomes. 3 Results\nWe apply the HTE-BH and HTE-Knockoff methods to two real experimental datasets. In the first experiment, both methods yield\nnearly identical selections for heterogeneous subgroups. The HTE results reveal drastically different effects in English-speaking countries versus\nnon-English-speaking countries. Retrospectively, we understood that the new layout in the experiment favored non-English content\nwhile suppressing high-quality content in English. This observation aligns with the\nsimulation results. Although we show that the Knockoff method can still perform\nwell in controlling FDR in some non-Gaussian error cases, there is no theoretical proof for such robustness.",
        "Conclusion": "4 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we propose the HTE-BH method for detecting heterogeneous subgroups with treatment effects different from the\naverage, and the HTE-Knockoff method for identifying factors contributing to the heterogeneity in treatment effects. 5"

        "Abstract": "Harmonizing Scaling Laws: Bridging the Gap\nBetween Kaplan and Chinchilla\nAbstract\nStudies by Kaplan et al. 1 Introduction\nTwo important studies by Kaplan et al. We define,\nNT=NE+NE, (1)\nNE= (h+v)d, (2)\nwhere d represents the transformer residual stream\u2019s dimension, v denotes the vocabulary size, and\nh stands for the context length (included only when positional embeddings are learned). (14)\nThis takes the same form as Equation 11 with \u03c9= (v + h)(A\n12)1/3. Substituting CT = 6NT D into\nEquation 8 yields:\nL(NT, CT ) =NcNT +Dc(CT/6NT)\u03a603b2 +E. But there are multiple other differences between the two studies that likely also affect scaling coeffi-\ncients (Section 6); datasets (Kaplan used OpenWebText2, Chinchilla used MassiveText), transformer\ndetails (Kaplan used learnable position embeddings while Chinchilla\u2019s were fixed, also differing\ntokenizers, vocabularly sizes), optimization scheme (Kaplan used scheme 3, Chinchilla scheme\n4, also differing warmup schedules), differences in computation counting (Kaplan used C = 6ND,\nChinchilla\u2019s Method 1 and 2 used a full calculation). does not depend on N . 8.2 Derivation of compute-loss analytical form in Equation 30\nThis section derives k, defined as:\nk=dlog(L)\ndlog(C).",
        "Methodology": "Kaplan suggested an optimal\nparameter count scaling with Noptimal \u221dC0.73, whereas Chinchilla proposed\nNoptimal \u221dC0.50. When the Chinchilla study is simulated under similar circumstances,\nbiased scaling coefficients similar to those of Kaplan are produced. As a result, this\nwork confirms Chinchilla\u2019s scaling coefficients by clarifying the primary reason for\nKaplan\u2019s initial overestimation. Both studies provided advice on how to balance model\nparameters (N) and training tokens (D) for a fixed computing budget (C), but their suggestions\nconflicted. Subsequently, LLMs\ntrained in the following years allocated more resources to model size and less to data size. This sparked a trend in which\nLLMs with smaller model sizes were trained using more data. This paper argues\nthat these explanations are insufficient and proposes a straightforward substitute: the majority of\nthe discrepancy is caused by Kaplan\u2019s decision to count non-embedding parameters instead of total\nparameters, together with the limited scale of their investigation. Additionally, it is discovered that this methodological discrepancy contributes to variations in the\nstated correlation between loss and compute. Specifically, this research provides the following:\n\u2022An analytical method is created to assess the scaling relationships described in the studies\n(Section 3). If non-embedding parameters are utilized, and at a smaller scale, this method\ndemonstrates that Kaplan\u2019s documented relationship is locally compatible with Chinchilla\u2019s. .\u2022We investigate the stated correlations between processing power and loss (Section 5). Once\nmore, the cause of Kaplan\u2019s skewed estimate is the use of non-embedding parameters and\nsmaller scale models, together with the lack of an offset term in their compute-loss equation. \u2022It is suggested that the scaling community use total parameters, total compute, and an offset\nin the compute-loss equation going forward. 2 Preliminaries\nThis section provides some foundational information and definitions (Section 2.1), summarizes\nthe analytical method used for our primary finding (Section 2.2), and documents our assumptions\n(Section 2.3). 2.1 Set Up\nKaplan et al. (2022) conducted empirical studies to model the relationships\nbetween the number of parameters (N), training tokens (D), training compute (C), and loss (L) in\ntransformers used for language modeling. The two studies differed in their definitions of N and C. Kaplan investigated relationships regarding\nnon-embedding parameters (N\nE) and non-embedding compute (C\nE), excluding contributions from embedding layers for vocabulary and position indices (NE). Utilizing\nthe typical approximation for training compute FLOPs C = 6ND (where a factor of 6 accounts for a\nforward and backward pass), we establish total and non-embedding compute as:\nCT= 6NTD = 6(NE+NE)D, (3)\nCE= 6NED. This is expressed as follows for total parameters (using \u22c6to\ndenote \"optimal\"):\nNT=argminL (NT, CT ). (10)\n2.2 Analysis Overview\nIn our analysis, we use data and insights from the Chinchilla and Kaplan studies to predict the scaling\nlaws that would result if the Chinchilla relationship were stated in terms of N\nE and C\nE, and this was done using the smaller model sizes used in Kaplan\u2019s study. It will be demonstrated that when NT is large, N\nE becomes an insignificant component of the model\u2019s parameters and computing cost. The embedding\nparameters are not insignificant when NT is smaller (this is the regime examined in Kaplan\u2019s study,\nwhich used parameters ranging from 768 to 1.5B). Our approach in Section 3 is broken down as follows:\n\u2022 Step 1. Fit a suitable function predicting N\nE from NT. \u2022 Step 2. Incorporate this function into a model predicting loss in terms of NT and CT.\n\u2022 Step 3. Analytically derive the relationship between N\nE and C\nE.\n\u2022Step 4. Simulate synthetic data from the Chinchilla loss model over the model sizes used in\nthe Kaplan study. Simply changing the basis from\nNT to N\nE yields coefficients consistent with Chinchilla and Kaplan, respectively, while varying token budgets\nand decay schedules does not. In order to examine the relationship between the\nideal loss L\nE and compute C\nE, Steps 3 and 4 are carried out once more using a similar analysis as before. To do this, we start with\nChinchilla data and adjust for the smaller model sizes utilized in Kaplan\u2019s investigation, the exclusion\nof embedding parameters and compute, and a different fitting function option. We are able to roughly\nrecover Kaplan\u2019s compute-loss coefficient and reconcile the two studies by making these adjustments. 32.3 Assumptions\nFor transparency, we list the assumptions and approximations made in our analysis. \u2022 We assume C\nE = 6N\nED and CT = 6NT D.\n\u2022We assume a fixed functional form between total and non-embedding parameters in Equation\n11, and fit \u03c9empirically using Chinchilla model configurations. \u2022We assume a fixed functional form between loss, total parameters, and training data given\nby Equation 8. \u2022We approximate Kaplan\u2019s models with 20 logarithmically spaced model sizes from 0.79k to\n1.58B non-embedding parameters. 3 Analysis: Compute-Parameter Scaling Coefficient\nThis section presents our core analysis. Step 1. Fit a suitable function predicting N\nE from NT. We need a suitable function connecting non-embedding and total parameters. We propose to use the\nform:\nNT=NE+\u03a603c9N1/3E (11)\nfor some constant \u03c9> 0. Consider Kaplan\u2019s approach to parameter counting:\nNT= 12ld2+NE, (12)\nwhere l represents the number of layers. (2022) for a range of NT (44M to 16B). The exponent is\nclose to 1/3, with an implied aspect ratio A = 39.2 (inferred from \u03c9). Step 2. Incorporate this function into a model predicting loss in terms of NT and CT. NT=argminL (NT, CT ). Analytically derive the relationship between N\nE and C\nE.\nTo determine the relationship between N\nE and C\nE, we take the derivative of Equation 18 with respect to N\nE, set it to zero, and rearrange:\nCE= 6NE(NE+\u03c9(NE)1/3)\u03b1(\u03b2Dc\n\u03b1Nc)(1\n1 +\u03c9\n3(NE)\u22122/3\n+\u03b1)\u22121(20)\nThis indicates that, generally, the relationship between N\nE and C\nE is not a power law. \u2022A transition phase exists where g briefly increases. This occurs between the two limits when\nN2/3\nEis of the same order as \u03c9. Simulate synthetic data from the Chinchilla loss model over the model sizes used in the\nKaplan study. Fit a local power law for N\nE in terms of C\nE.\nBy reading g, we could estimate a local power law and thus a scaling coefficient for a specific value\nof N\nE. However, it is unclear which N\nE value is representative of the Kaplan study. We choose a more accurate estimation approach,\ncreating synthetic training curves from Equation 18 over the range of model sizes employed in the\nKaplan study, and fitting coefficients using models that lie on the compute-efficient frontier. This will\nalso validate our analytical expression for N\nE and C\nE in Equation 19. We simulated 20 models with N\nE ranging from 790 parameters to 1.58B (Kaplan reports using model sizes \"ranging in size from\n768 to 1.5 billion non-embedding parameters\"). The estimated scaling coefficient is shown when a power law is fitted to the compute\noptimal frontier (Chinchilla\u2019s Method 1) generated by these synthetic training curves. Five models with sizes NT \u2208[0.8M, 1.6M, 2.1M, 3.3M, 4.6M] were trained using the BookCorpus\ndataset. The GPT-2 tokenizer was used, with a vocabulary size of 50,257 and a context length of\n16 (although this is much less than normal, our tests indicate that context length has no impact on\nscaling coefficients). To estimate scaling coefficients, Chinchilla\u2019s Method 1 was applied, using the\napproximation C = 6ND. Models were trained for updates \u2208[4000, 4000, 4000, 8000, 8000], with a batch size of 65,536\ntokens per update, for a total of training tokens D \u2208[262M, 262M, 262M, 524M, 524M]. For each\nmodel size, the optimal learning rate was selected from \u2208[0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05], and no annealing\nwas implemented. A single learning rate of 0.001 is set for all models. A single model is trained per\nsize, and no annealing is applied. The best learning rate is chosen per model. A single model is trained per size,\nand no annealing is applied. The best learning rate is chosen per model. A single model is trained per size,\nand cosine annealing is applied at the update budget. (Kaplan study used this.) The best learning rate is chosen per model. Six models are trained per size at\ndifferent budgets \u2208[0.25D, 0.5D, 0.75D, 1.0D, 1.5D, 2.0D], and cosine annealing is applied. This might account for our minor\noverestimation of the scaling coefficients in Equations 21 and 22. Note that the change\nmoving from NT to N\nE has a much larger effect than moving between optimization schemes. 5 Analysis: Compute-Loss Scaling Coefficient\nIn addition to examining the compute-optimal parameter scaling, Kaplan and Chinchilla also char-\nacterized the scaling relationship between compute and loss, assuming optimal parameter scaling. Kaplan expressed this optimal loss in terms of non-embedding compute, while Chinchilla used total\ncompute. LE=minL (NE, CE ), s.t.CE = 6NED, (24)\n7LT=minL (NT, CT ), s.t.CT = 6NTD. Our analysis follows the same four-step approach as in Section 3. We can directly reuse Steps 1 and\n2, while Steps 3 and 4 are now modified to study the relationship between optimal loss and compute,\nrather than optimal parameters and compute as previously. Step 3. Analytically derive the relationship between L\nE and C\nE.\nWe determine that the relationship between L\nE and C\nE is not a power law (derived in Section A.2). Simulate synthetic data from the Chinchilla loss model over the model sizes used in the\nKaplan study. Fit a local power law for L\nE in terms of C\nE, using Kaplan\u2019s compute-loss form. However, we again opt for the more faithful procedure of simulating data from the\nloss curves. We speculate that this might be the\nmotivation for Kaplan\u2019s selection of this simpler compute-loss form. 6 Related work\nAfter early research that established how language models get better with parameters, data, and\ntraining computation, there has been research into the theoretical underpinnings of these scaling laws\nand whether they apply to other domains. The methodology for determining scaling\ncoefficients is revisited by Su et al. Our discovery is subtly different; a straightforward\nfixed learning rate will recover extremely comparable compute-parameter scaling coefficients as\nmany cosine schedules. (2024)\u2019s concurrent work is to clarify the discrepancies between the Kaplan\nand Chinchilla coefficients, which is the same goal as that of our paper. We have used\nan entirely analytical method to identify the main \"first order\" cause using just the data that was\nmade publicly available in the two papers. (As a form of verification, tiny-scale experiments were\nconducted post-hoc.) We discovered two problems with Kaplan\u2019s study that, when taken together, biased their\nestimated scaling coefficients: they focused on smaller model sizes and only counted coefficients:\nthey focused on smaller model sizes and only counted non-embedding parameters. At greater values of NT, the\nembedding parameter counts become negligible, NT = N, and differences would not arise. Existing literature on scaling is not consistent in its use of\nnon-embedding vs. total compute. Some studies follow Kaplan\u2019s approach, using non-embedding\nparameters or compute, while others adhere to the Chinchilla approach, using total parameters. Our\nwork indicates that this choice can substantially alter scaling exponents, complicating cross-study\ncomparisons. Similarly, the choice of compute-loss equation varies through the literature. Studies\nsuch as opt for the Kaplan compute-loss form without offsets. In contrast, employ the Chinchilla\ncompute-loss form with non-zero offsets. Again, our work suggests that these methodological\ndifferences can lead to significant variations in scaling predictions and interpretations. We see our work as helping to understand certain decisions made in previous\nstudies that should be standardized. Concretely, we advise future studies to report total, rather than\nnon-embedding, parameters, and to include an offset in the compute-loss fitting models. We discuss\nmotivation for these choices below. Word embeddings can be\nfactorized into semantically interpretable factors (even the shallow Word2vec). LLMs learn linear\nembeddings of space and time across scales. Therefore, if one believes\nthat the embedding layer does more than just \u2018translate\u2019 tokens to a vector of the correct dimension,\nwe see no reason to exclude them in the parameter count. Why should a non-zero offset be used in loss-compute predictions? This approach accounts for the concept of irreducible risk, which posits a lower bound on\nachievable loss regardless of model or dataset size. This may arise from various factors: inherent\nbiases or limitations in the learning algorithm, or noise in the original task. We acknowledge several limitations of our analysis.

        "Results and Findings": "(2020) and Hoffmann et al. (2022) examined the scaling\ncharacteristics of transformers in next-token language prediction, yielding different\nrecommendations for configuring the number of parameters (N) and training tokens\n(D) to minimize loss within a set compute budget (C). This paper demonstrates that a significant portion of this\ndifference can be traced back to Kaplan\u2019s focus on non-embedding parameters,\nrather than the total parameter count, along with their study\u2019s concentration on a\nsmaller scale. Additionally, this research clarifies variations in\nthe stated correlations between computational loss and budget. As a result of these\nfindings, we advocate for upcoming scaling investigations to utilize total parameter\ncounts and overall computational resources. (2020) and Hoffmann et al. (2022) examined how scale\naffects large language models (LLMs). The\nChinchilla research that came after that discovered that Noptimal \u221dC0.50and Doptimal \u221dC0.50,\nwhich resulted in their main argument that \"for many current LLMs, smaller models should have\nbeen trained on more tokens to achieve the most performant model.\" (2020) and Hoffmann et al. Our work presents results using both specifications. Chinchilla :Nc= 406 .4, Dc= 410 .7,= 0.3392,\u03a603b2 = 0 .2849, E= 1.693 = \u03a621d2NTC 0.46T,\n(9)\nEpochAI :Nc= 482 .0, Dc= 2085 .43,= 0.3478,\u03a603b2 = 0 .3658, E= 1.817 = \u03a621d2NTC 0.51T. We discover that the relationship between N\nE and C\nE is not, in fact, a power law at the lower end of this range. However, fitting a \"local\" power law at\nthis modest scale yields a coefficient that is comparable to Kaplan\u2019s, roughly reconciling these two\nfindings. A second, connected contribution is made in Section 5. We report results using both the Chinchilla (Equation 9) and Epoch AI\n(Equation 10) fitted constants. We demonstrate that a local scaling coefficient ranging from\n0.74 to 0.78 (close to Kaplan\u2019s 0.73) can emerge when calculated in terms of non-embedding parame-\nters within the small-parameter regime, while remaining consistent with Chinchilla\u2019s coefficient. Apart from having several desirable properties (strictly increasing and lim\nNT\u2192 \u221e NT = N\nE2), it can be supported by findings from both the Kaplan and Chinchilla studies. They determine that\nmodels of a given size exhibit similar performance across a range of aspect ratios, and this is not\ninfluenced by model scale (their Figure 5). Consequently, we could propose a sizing scheme with a\nfixed aspect ratio (A \u224840 appears reasonable from their plots). (13)\nObserving that N\nE =12\nAd3\u2192d = (N\nEA\n12)1/3, and combining with NE = (v + h)d,\nNT\u2248NE+ (v+h)(A\n12)1/3N1/3E. We empirically fit a function NT = N\nE +\u03c9N\u03b4\nE(note the learnable exponent) to the Chinchilla model configurations listed in Table A9 of Hoffmann\n4et al. Fitting a model with numpy\u2019s polyfit yields coefficients \u03c9= 47491 and \u03b4= 0.34. (17)\nBy differentiating Equation 16 with respect to NT, setting the result to zero, and rearranging in terms\nof NT, we obtain:\nNT=CT\u03b2\n\u03b1+\u03b2(\u03b2Dc\n\u03b16\u03b2Nc)1\n\u03b1+\u03b2, orsimplyNT \u221dC\u03b2\n\u03b1+\u03b2 (18)\nWe now modify Equation 16 to be in terms of non-embedding parameters and compute. That is,\nfor a specific value of N\nE, there exists a constant g that provides a first-order approximation (denoted by \u221d) N\nE, where g is defined as:\ng:=dlog(CE)\ndlog(NE)=1\n1\u22121\n\u03b2\u03c9\n3(NE)\u22122/3\n51+\u03c9\n3(NE)\u22122/3+\u03b1+ 1\u03b2\u03c9\n3(NE)\u22122/31+\u03c9\n3(NE)\u22122/3. There are three phases. Indeed, at exactly the point N2/3\nE=\u03c9, we have NT = N\nE +\u03c9N1/3\nE= NT = 2N\nE, indicating a 50/50 split between embedding and non-embedding parameters. For other constants in Equation 18, we adopt the\nEpoch AI specification (Equation 10) and \u03c9= 47491, though we also report results for the Chinchilla\nspecification (Equation 9). This represents\nour primary finding - by starting with a model from the Chinchilla study and modifying two aspects\nto match Kaplan\u2019s study (NT \u2192N\nE, small model sizes 0.79k - 1.58B parameters), we obtain local scaling coefficients:\nEpochAI :NEC 0.78E, (22)\nChinchilla :NEC 0.74E, (23)\nwhich are close to the Kaplan coefficient of 0.73. Experiment 1. First, we confirm if scaling coefficients approximate those of Chinchilla and Kaplan\nwhen employing NT and N\nE, respectively. When coefficients are fitted to NT, we obtain NT \u221dC0.49T, and for N\nE, we obtain N\nE\u221dC0.74\nE. These closely match the Chinchilla and Kaplan coefficients, respectively. Experiment 2. We present an ablation of optimization schemes, demonstrating that using multi-\nple training budgets per model has a negligible impact on coefficients (contrary to Chinchilla\u2019s\nexplanation). In contrast to Chinchilla\u2019s assertion that\nswitching from Kaplan\u2019s scheme 3 to scheme 4 would lower the scaling coefficient, our research\nindicates the opposite, with an increase from 0.46 to 0.49. dlog(LE)\ndlog(CE)=NE(NE+\u03c9(NE)1/3\n)\u03b1(11+\u03c9\n3(NE)\u22122/3)LE(6NE)\u03b2(31)\nNevertheless, we can once more take into account a local first-order approximation, L\nE\u221dCk\nE, where k =dlog (LE)\ndlog (CE). Using Kaplan\u2019s compute-loss form L\nE = (CE\nCo)\u03b3, we obtain the following models for the two specifications:\nEpochAI :LECE, (32)\nChinchilla :LECE, (33)\nwhich are roughly in line with Kaplan\u2019s reported coefficient of L\nE\u221dC\u22120.057\nE.\n8We observe that Kaplan\u2019s form provides a good fit of the data in the non-embedding compute plot\nat a small scale, over the range of model sizes they considered. Hagele et al. (2024) discovered that multiple short\ndecays with a constant learning rate or stochastic weight averaging may be used to recreate numerous\nindependent cosine schedules more effectively. The impact of different hyperparameters on scaling laws is examined by Bi\net al. They point out that different text datasets yield somewhat different optimal coefficients,\nwith \"cleaner\" data exhibiting more parameter-hungry scaling behavior, which they believe may\npartially account for the discrepancy between the Kaplan and Chinchilla coefficients. We believe that these findings complement our own. This shows how mathematical techniques can be used in scaling\u2019s empirical\nscience. Inconsistency across scaling studies. Furthermore, our initial evidence does not support using multiple\n9cosine decays per model size \u2013 we find a single fixed learning rate per model size is sufficient for\nmeasuring compute-optimal parameter coefficients. Several works provide evidence\nthat embedding parameters capture meaningful language properties. Developing such meaningful embedding structures\nallows LLMs to perform high-level language operations, such as arithmetic. (34)\nFirst note that\ndlog(C)\ndlog(N)=dlog(C)\ndNdN\ndlog(N)=dlog(C)\ndNN (35)\nRecall the definition of Cfrom Equation 19:\nC= 6N(N+\u03c9(N)(1/3))(\u03b1)((\u03b2Dc\n\u03b1Nc))((1\n1 +\u03c9\n3(N)(\u22122/3) +\u03b1))(\u22121) (36)\nlog(C) =log(N)\u22121\n\u03b2log(1 +\u03c9\n3(N)(\u22122/3)) +\u03b1+ 1\n\u03b2log(N+\u03c9(N)(1/3)) +const (37)\nwhere const.

        "Methodology": "Due to the complexity of a deep neural model, however, it is difficult\nto explain its decisions.

This is why explanation methods\nneed to move beyond the weights, the authors explain, and they propose the methods \u201cPatternNet\u201d\nand \u201cPatternAttribution\u201d that learn explanations from data. 2 Methodology\nKindermans et al. assume that the data x passed to a linear model wTx=yis composed of signal\n(s) and noise (d, from distraction) x=s+d.

(1)\nThey go on to explain that a good signal estimator S(x) = \u02c6sshould comply to the conditions in Eqs. 1 but that these alone form an ill-posed quality criterion since S(x) =u(wTu)\u22121yalready satisfies\nthem for any u for which wTu\u0338= 0. 2 yields maximum values for signal estimators that remove most of the\ninformation about yin the noise.

        "Abstract": "Advancements in Audio-Visual Active Speaker\nDetection: A Novel Approach for the ActivityNet\nChallenge\nAbstract\nThis document outlines our contribution to the ActivityNet Challenge, focusing on\nactive speaker detection.",
        "Methodology": "We employ a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)\nfor feature extraction, combined with an ensemble of temporal convolution and\nLSTM classifiers to determine whether a person who is visible is also speaking. 1 Introduction\nThe field of multimodal speech perception has garnered significant attention in recent times, with\nmajor advancements in audio-visual methodologies facilitated by deep learning. The capacity to\nidentify which individuals are speaking at any moment is crucial for a variety of applications. This document provides a concise analysis of this dataset and elaborates on the methodology behind\nour submission to the challenge. The ground truth labels are available for the training and\nvalidation sets. Consequently, the system\nneeds to deliver precise detection with a limited number of frames. Traditional methods, which\ndepend on smoothing the output over a time window of several seconds, are not effective under these\nconditions. Additionally, the dataset includes many older videos where the audio and video recordings appear to\nhave been captured separately or are significantly out of sync. .2 Methodology\nThe active speaker detection system is composed of two primary components: front-end feature\nextractors and a back-end classifier, each discussed in detail in the subsequent sections. These\nencoder networks have undergone training for the audio-visual correspondence task through a self-\nsupervised approach on unlabeled videos. The video encoder utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN), processing 5 RGB image frames\nto produce a 512-dimensional representation. The audio encoder receives an input comprising 20 frames in the temporal dimension and 13 cepstral\ncoefficients in the other, generating a 512-dimensional representation that aligns with the video\nrepresentation\u2019s embedding space. Consequently, for an input of T frames, the output\ndimensions are 512 x (T - 4). LSTM classifier. The audio and video representations are channeled into two distinct bi-directional\nLSTM networks, each comprising 2 layers with a hidden size of 128. The outputs from these networks\nare merged and subsequently processed through a linear classification layer. This layer determines\nwhether the individual is speaking, and it is trained using the softmax cross-entropy loss. In place of LSTM layers, the encoder outputs are directed to two temporal convolution\nlayers, each equipped with 128 filters. The outputs are similarly concatenated and forwarded to the\nclassifier, mirroring the approach used with the LSTM classifier. Ensemble methods in machine learning have been demonstrated to frequently surpass\nthe performance of any individual classifier. Smoothing. To mitigate noise within the predictions, the outputs of the classifiers undergo temporal\nsmoothing using either a median or Wiener filter, both applied over 0.5-second intervals. Training utilized the ADAM optimizer with default settings and a fixed learning\nrate of 10-2. To counteract any bias in the training data, the number of samples for positive and\nnegative classes was balanced within each mini-batch during the training process. The evaluation metric for this task is the mean Average Precision (mAP), with the evaluation code\nsupplied by the challenge organizers. In contrast, the\nGRU-based baseline model yielded an mAP of 0.821. The qualitative outcomes of the proposed method significantly surpass those of existing\ncorrespondence-based methods on this dataset because it does not depend on accurate audio-to-\nvideo synchronization.",
        "Results and Findings": "The results demonstrate substantial improvements compared to the established\nbaseline on the A V A-ActiveSpeaker dataset. The durations of speaking segments are notably brief, with\nan average of 1.11 seconds for segments that are both spoken and audible. 2.1 Front-end architecture\nFor the extraction of audio and video representations, pre-trained networks are employed. In this study, two straightforward back-end classifiers are evaluated. Although our experiments utilize T = 9, no significant performance variations were noted for T values\nwithin the range of 7 to 15. Results on the validation set for the various back-end classifiers are presented in Table 2.",

        "Abstract": "Overview of Challenges in Trajectory Forecasting and\n3D Perception for Autonomous Driving\nAbstract\nThis document provides a summary of the challenges faced in the domain of\nAutonomous Driving.",
        "Methodology": "Our vehicle operates in urban settings during peak traffic times. This newly created dataset, which includes 150 minutes of sequential information, is extensive and\nconcentrates on urban roadways, with a particular emphasis on 3D perception, prediction, planning,\nand simulation activities involving a variety of traffic agents. Measurements for position and bounding box dimensions are\nprovided in meters. There are five distinct categories for object types: small vehicles are designated\nas 1, large vehicles as 2, pedestrians as 3, motorcyclists and bicyclists as 4, traffic cones as 5, and\nothers as 6. The challenge requires using the initial three seconds of data from each sequence as\ninput to forecast the trajectories of objects for the subsequent three seconds. The objects assessed are\nthose present in the final frame of the first three seconds. Subsequently, the discrepancies between\nthe anticipated locations and the actual locations of these objects are calculated. The following metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms:\n1. Average Displacement Error (ADE): This metric represents the average Euclidean distance between\nall predicted positions and their corresponding actual positions throughout the forecasting period. Given the varying scales of trajectories\nfor vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists, a weighted sum of ADE (WSADE) and a weighted sum of\nFDE (WSFDE) are employed as metrics. It was gathered in Beijing, China, under diverse conditions of lighting and\ntraffic density. An entry within each file includes the frame number, object ID, object\nclassification, positions along the x, y, and z axes, object dimensions (length, width, height), and\norientation. Object classifications are consistent with those in the trajectory data. In this evaluation, the\nfirst two categories\u2014small and large vehicles\u2014are considered as a single \u2019vehicle\u2019 class. 3.2.2 Evaluation Metric\nThe evaluation metric is analogous to the one defined in prior work. These\ndetectors should estimate the 3D bounding box (dimensions and position) and provide a detection\nscore or confidence. It is important to note that not all objects within the point clouds are labeled. The performance of 3D object detection is assessed using the mean Average Precision (mAP),\nbased on Intersection over Union (IoU). The evaluation standard aligns with the 2D object detection\nbenchmark, utilizing 3D bounding box overlap. 24 Methods and Teams\n4.1 Trajectory prediction\nOne team utilized an encoder-decoder framework based on LSTM for predicting trajectories on city\nstreets. To enhance prediction accuracy, they implemented four sequence-to-sequence sub-models\nto capture the distinct movement characteristics of various traffic participants. They produced a\nfuture trajectory for each agent through a three-step process: encoding, perturbation, and decoding. Initially, an encoder was employed to embed the past trajectory. Subsequently, they introduced a\n16-dimensional random noise to the encoder\u2019s output to accommodate the multimodal distribution of\nthe data. Improving upon the original methodology, they conducted an interaction operation at each\nmoment during the encoding and decoding phases. The interaction module embedded the positions\nof all agents and generated a comprehensive 128-dimensional spatiotemporal representation using\nan LSTM unit. The derived feature was then relayed to the encoders or decoders for the primary\nprediction task. Each encoder or decoder, linked to a particular individual, produced the private\ninteraction within a confined area through an attention operation, utilizing the aforementioned global\nfeature and the agent\u2019s position. 4.2 3D Detection\nOne team introduced an innovative approach termed sparse-to-dense 3D object detector (STD). The initial phase involves a bottom-up\nnetwork for generating proposals, where spherical anchors are seeded on each point to encompass\nobjects at various orientations. This spherical anchor design reduces computational load and shortens\ninference time by eliminating the need to account for differently oriented objects during anchor\ncreation. Subsequently, points within these spherical anchors are collected to form proposals for\nadditional refinement. In the second phase, a PointsPool layer is introduced to transform the features\nof proposals from point-based representations to compact grid formats. A 3D intersection-over-union (IoU) branch is also incorporated into the\nprediction head to estimate the 3D IoU between the final predictions and the ground-truth bounding\nboxes, thereby enhancing localization precision. During the training process, four distinct data augmentation techniques were employed to mitigate\noverfitting. Initially, similar to previous methods, ground-truth bounding boxes with their correspond-\ning interior points were randomly added from different scenes to the existing point cloud, simulating\nobjects in varied settings. Subsequently, each bounding box was randomly rotated based on a uniform\ndistribution and subjected to random translation. Additionally, every point cloud was randomly\nflipped along the x-axis with a 50% probability. In the testing phase, predictions were\nfirst obtained on both the original and the x-axis flipped point clouds, and these results were then\nmerged using Soft-NMS to produce the final predictions. The k-means algorithm was utilized to create five anchors for each class. Another modification involved deactivating the direction classification in the loss function, as the\nevaluation metric relies on IOU, which is not affected by direction. To enhance training data, global translation and scaling of the point cloud, along with rotation and\ntranslation for each ground truth, were implemented. Global rotation of the point cloud was omitted\nas it was found to produce less favorable outcomes. The specific parameters for these adjustments are\ndetailed in Table 2. MNP indicates the maximum number of points, and MNV\nrepresents the maximum number of voxels. For every point cloud, four iterations\nwere generated: the original, and versions flipped along the x-axis, y-axis, and both axes. Each\niteration was processed by the network to obtain bounding box predictions, which were subsequently\nunflipped. Due to the flipping operation, anchors across iterations have a one-to-one correspondence. For each anchor, the corresponding predicted boxes were combined by averaging the location, size,\nand class probability. Redundant boxes were then eliminated using Non-Maximum Suppression\n(NMS). Another Team introduced enhancements to the PointPillars method. Their approach incorporated\nresidual learning and channel attention mechanisms into the baseline architecture. The network is\ncomposed of the original Pillar Feature Network, an extended 2D CNN backbone, and a detection\nhead for foreground/background classification and regression. The deeper backbone significantly\nimproves detection accuracy compared to the original PointPillars. A separate network was trained\nfor each class in the Apollo training dataset to perform binary classification, resulting in four distinct\nnetworks. For dataset preprocessing, methods from the KITTI dataset were adapted, including positive example\nsampling, global rotation, individual object rotation, and random scaling for each object. However,\nunlike the KITTI approach, global rotation was excluded, and the ranges for scaling and rotation were\nreduced. Table 3 details the specific settings for each class. It is anticipated that this paper\nwill offer contemporary insights into these research areas. Future endeavors will aim to refine the open-source tools and dataset for autonomous driving.

        "Abstract": "A Bayesian Perspective on Cross-Cultural Morality:\nInvestigating Astrobiological and Cognitive\nDimensions\nAbstract\nBayesian Theology for Extra-Terrestrial Diplomacy explores the potential for\nmeaningful interactions with extraterrestrial civilizations by integrating Bayesian\ninference and theological inquiry. Our research has far-reaching implications for the\nfield of astrodiplomacy, highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates\nphilosophical, theological, and scientific perspectives.",
        "Methodology": "This novel approach establishes a probabilistic\nframework to evaluate the compatibility of ethical systems across planetary cultures,\nfocusing on shared moral frameworks as the foundation for interstellar diplomacy. By combining Bayesian analysis with philosophical perspectives, the study aims\nto uncover common moral structures that could enable cooperative and mutually\nbeneficial relationships. The framework draws insights from diverse disciplines like astrobiology, exopale-\nontology, and extremophile studies to predict moral systems influenced by varied\nenvironmental conditions. Bayesian models applied to hypothetical alien encoun-\nters systematically evaluate risks, benefits, and strategic protocols for interspecies\ndiplomacy. This interdisciplinary research also examines the nature of morality and its role in\ninterspecies communication. For instance, a civilization that develops on\na planet with scarce resources may be more likely to adopt a utilitarian moral framework, whereas a\ncivilization that evolves in a resource-rich environment may be more inclined towards a deontological\napproach. In addition to these considerations, it is also essential to examine the potential implications of\nencountering an alien civilization with a moral framework that is fundamentally at odds with our\nown. Moreover, the prospect of encountering alien civilizations with disparate moral frameworks also\nprompts us to reexamine our own moral assumptions and the values that underlie human society. By quantifying the uncertainty associated with these encounters,\nwe may uncover new insights into the potential for cooperation and conflict, as well as the moral and\nethical implications of our actions. As we continue to advance in our search for life beyond Earth, it\nis essential that we develop a deeper understanding of the potential for shared moral frameworks with\nalien civilizations, and that we establish a framework for intergalactic diplomacy that is informed\nby a nuanced and multifaceted approach to morality and ethics. By doing so, we may uncover new\n2avenues for cooperation and mutual understanding, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and\npeaceful universe. At its core, this field seeks to develop a\nprobabilistic framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human\nand alien civilizations. This endeavor is inherently complex, as it requires an integration of insights\nfrom theology, astrobiology, philosophy, and diplomacy, among other disciplines. One of the foundational challenges in this field is the development of a rigorous methodology for\ninferring the probability of shared moral frameworks. However, the application of these techniques\nto the field of extra-terrestrial diplomacy is still in its infancy, and significant work remains to be\ndone in order to develop a robust and reliable methodology. In addition to the methodological challenges, there are also significant theoretical and conceptual\nhurdles that must be overcome. As such, it is possible that alien\ncivilizations may possess moral frameworks that are fundamentally incompatible with our own. Despite these challenges, there have been several notable attempts to develop a framework for\nunderstanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations. However, their application to the field of extra-terrestrial diplomacy is still\nhighly speculative, and significant work remains to be done in order to develop a rigorous and reliable\nframework for predicting the behavior of alien civilizations. This approach recognizes that human\nmorality is shaped by a complex array of cultural, historical, and environmental factors, and seeks to\nidentify potential parallels and analogies with alien civilizations. However, this approach is still highly speculative, and significant work remains to\nbe done in order to develop a rigorous and reliable framework for understanding the potential for\nshared moral frameworks. While this approach is certainly unorthodox, it has garnered significant\nattention and interest in certain quarters, and may potentially provide a novel and innovative means\nof facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations. These are\ncomplex and difficult questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis. If we were to discover that certain\nmoral principles are universal and shared across multiple civilizations, would this provide evidence\nfor the existence of a universal moral law, or would it simply reflect the fact that certain moral\nprinciples are highly adaptable and useful in a wide range of contexts? These are important questions,\nand ones that require careful consideration and analysis. As such, significant work remains to be done in order to develop a rigorous and\nreliable framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and\nalien civilizations. These are important questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis. These\nare important questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis. While this approach is certainly unorthodox, it has garnered significant attention and\ninterest in certain quarters, and may potentially provide a novel and innovative means of facilitating\ncommunication and understanding between human and alien civilizations. If we were to encounter an alien civilization\nthat possesses a fundamentally incompatible moral framework, would we be morally obligated to\nattempt to understand and respect their perspective, or would we be justified in prioritizing our own\nmoral and ethical principles? These are complex and difficult questions, and ones that require careful\nconsideration and analysis. In a surprising development, some researchers have also proposed the use of artificial intelligence\nas a means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations. The idea behind this approach is that artificial intelligence may provide a means of transcending the\nlimitations of human language and cognition, and facilitating a deeper understanding of alternative\nmoral frameworks and modes of cognition. While this approach is still highly speculative, it has\ngarnered significant attention and interest in certain quarters, and may potentially provide a novel\nand innovative means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien\ncivilizations. While significant work remains to be done in order to develop a rigorous\nand reliable framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human\nand alien civilizations, the potential rewards are significant. Furthermore, it is also essential to consider the potential implications of encountering alien civiliza-\ntions that possess advanced technologies and capabilities. These are complex and difficult questions, and\nones that require careful consideration and analysis. 3 Methodology\nTo develop a comprehensive framework for Bayesian Theology in the context of Extra-Terrestrial\nDiplomacy, we first established a foundational understanding of the theological and philosophical\nunderpinnings of moral frameworks across potential alien civilizations. This involved an exhaustive\nreview of terrestrial religious and ethical systems, seeking commonalities and divergences that\ncould inform our hypotheses about extraterrestrial moralities. We hypothesized that any civilization\nadvanced enough to communicate with us would have grappled with similar fundamental questions\nregarding the nature of existence, the balance between individual and collective well-being, and the\nrole of altruism versus self-preservation. A critical component of our methodology was the development of a novel Bayesian inference engine,\nwhich we term \"Xenothetic Inference Module\" (XIM). The XIM is designed to integrate disparate data\nstreams, including but not limited to: astrobiological findings, the spectral analysis of exoplanetary\natmospheres, patterns in celestial mechanics that could indicate the presence of megastructures,\nand even the detection of mathematical or linguistic patterns in purported alien transmissions. By\ncontinuously updating its probabilistic models based on new evidence, the XIM aims to estimate the\nlikelihood of encountering civilizations with moral frameworks that overlap with our own, facilitating\nmore effective and ethical communication strategies. We posited that civilizations capable of harnessing entanglement for communication\nmight develop unique ethical perspectives, given the fundamentally non-local character of their\ninterconnectedness. By examining the diversity of imagined\nextraterrestrial societies and their ethical dilemmas, we aimed to catalog a wide range of possible\nmoral frameworks that could exist elsewhere in the universe. Moreover, we invested significant effort into developing a taxonomy of potential alien value sys-\ntems, categorizing them based on their putative ethical, utilitarian, deontological, or virtue-based\norientations. This classification scheme, while not exhaustive, provided a structured framework for\npredicting how different types of civilizations might interact with humanity, based on their inferred\nmoral principles. An intriguing outcome of this work was the realization that certain forms of alien\nlife, particularly those with collective or hive-minded consciousness, might adopt moral frameworks\nthat are incommensurable with human ethical discourse, challenging our assumptions about the\nuniversality of moral values. By broadcasting an essence of human morality into the\ncosmos, we hoped to stimulate a form of \"moral resonance\" that could, in theory, be detected or\nresponded to by civilizations attuned to similar ethical frequencies. Through these multifaceted approaches, our study endeavored to bridge the gap between the scientific\npursuit of extraterrestrial life and the philosophical exploration of moral universalism. By synthesizing\ninsights from theology, ethics, astrobiology, and quantum mechanics, we sought to illuminate the\nintricate, uncharted landscape of interstellar morality, navigating toward a deeper understanding of\nthe shared moral frameworks that might unite intelligent life across the cosmos. Ultimately, our\nmethodology, though eclectic and provocative, underscores the profound complexity and richness of\nexploring the moral dimensions of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The methodology employed a multi-faceted approach, incorporating\nelements of astrobiology, cognitive psychology, and philosophical theology. Initially, a comprehen-\nsive review of existing literature on the Fermi Paradox, the Drake Equation, and the Zoo Hypothesis\nwas undertaken to contextualize the research within the broader discourse of extraterrestrial life\nand its potential implications for human society. To further ground the research in empirical data, a mixed-methods survey was administered to a\nsample of 10,000 individuals, representing a cross-section of the global population in terms of\ndemographic variables such as age, gender, geographical location, and socio-economic status. The\nsurvey instrument consisted of a combination of Likert scale questions, open-ended prompts, and a\nnovel \"Moral Dilemma Resolution\" task, which presented participants with a series of hypothetical\nscenarios involving conflicts between individual rights and collective well-being, and asked them to\nprovide narrative responses detailing their decision-making processes. The data generated from this\nsurvey were then subjected to a Bayesian analysis, utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nsimulations to estimate the posterior distributions of parameters representing the probability of shared\nmoral values among humans and, by extension, potentially among alien civilizations. Within this virtual environment, participants were presented\nwith a series of moral dilemmas tailored to the specific context of interstellar relations, such as the\nmanagement of resources, the resolution of conflicts, and the balancing of individual freedoms with\ncollective security. The responses generated by participants during these simulated encounters were\nthen analyzed using a combination of natural language processing and thematic analysis, aiming to\nidentify patterns and themes that could inform the development of a shared moral framework for\nhuman-alien diplomacy. In addition to these experimental protocols, a range of secondary analyses were conducted to explore\nthe implications of the research for our understanding of the human condition and the potential\nfor moral growth and evolution in the context of interstellar relations. 7The IMA model is predicated on the assumption that the emergence of complex life and, subsequently,\nmoral frameworks, is influenced by a combination of universal principles and contingent factors. By integrating insights from astrophysics, astrobiology, and the philosophy of morality, we have\nendeavored to create a comprehensive and adaptable framework for predicting the probability of\nshared moral values. Notably, our model incorporates an innovative \"Moral Similarity Index\" (MSI),\nwhich serves as a quantitative metric for evaluating the degree of congruence between disparate moral\nsystems. To facilitate a more robust understanding of the IMA model\u2019s predictive capabilities, we conducted\nan extensive series of simulations, incorporating a diverse range of parameters and initial conditions. Beyond this threshold, the predicted probability undergoes a precipitous decline, implying that the\nemergence of shared moral frameworks is highly sensitive to the proximity of civilizations. Furthermore, our research has also explored the intriguing possibility of \"moral harmonic resonance,\"\nwherein the collective moral values of multiple civilizations become synchronized, giving rise to a\nharmonious and cohesive interstellar moral framework. This phenomenon is hypothesized to occur\nwhen the MSI values of participating civilizations exceed a critical threshold, thereby facilitating\nthe emergence of a unified and shared moral perspective. While the existence of moral harmonic\nresonance remains purely speculative at this juncture, our simulations suggest that it could potentially\nplay a pivotal role in shaping the moral landscape of the galaxy, particularly in regions with high\ndensities of intelligent life. The IMA model, with its incorporated MSI and\nquantum fluctuations, has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for predicting the probability of shared\nmoral frameworks, while the phenomenon of moral harmonic resonance offers a compelling vision\nof a harmonious and unified interstellar moral landscape. As we continue to explore the vast expanse\nof the galaxy, it is our hope that this research will contribute meaningfully to the development of\n8a more sophisticated and nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between intelligent\nlife, morality, and the cosmos. Through the application of Bayesian inference, we have developed a novel framework for assessing\nthe probability of convergent moral values amongst extraterrestrial intelligences. This approach has\nfacilitated a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between moral philosophy, astrobiology,\nand the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. One of the most significant contributions of our study is the introduction of the concept of \"moral\nmirror symmetry,\" which posits that the probability of shared moral values between two civilizations\nis directly proportional to the degree of symmetry between their respective moral frameworks. Furthermore, our research has also explored the possibility of\nusing Bayesian inference to identify \"moral anomalies\" - instances where the observed behavior of\nan alien civilization deviates significantly from the predicted moral framework. Moreover, our study has also explored the possibility of using artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning algorithms to simulate the evolution of moral frameworks in alien civilizations. As we continue to explore the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the potential for interstellar\n9cooperation and conflict, it is essential that we develop a deeper understanding of the moral and\nphilosophical principles that underlie the actions and decisions of alien civilizations. By pursuing this line of research, we may ultimately uncover new and innovative solutions\nto the complex challenges of astrodiplomacy, and develop a more profound understanding of the\nintricate web of moral and philosophical relationships that bind us to the stars.",
        "Results and Findings": "Furthermore, our team conducted an extensive survey of science fiction literature and cinema,\nanalyzing depictions of alien civilizations and their moral structures. In an effort to further validate the findings, a table was constructed to summarize the results of the\nsurvey and the simulated alien encounter protocol, as shown below: The estimates presented in this\nTable 1: Probability Estimates of Shared Moral Values among Humans and Alien Civilizations\nMoral Value Human-Human Human-Alien (Simulated) Human-Alien (Moral Downloading)\nRespect for Life 0.85 0.62 0.81\nCooperation 0.78 0.58 0.75\nFairness 0.82 0.65 0.80\nIndividual Rights 0.75 0.55 0.70\nCollective Well-being 0.80 0.60 0.78\ntable suggest that, while there may be some degree of overlap in the moral values held by humans\nand hypothetical alien civilizations, there are also significant discrepancies and uncertainties that\nmust be accounted for in the development of a shared moral framework for interstellar diplomacy. The results of these experiments were mixed, with\nsome participants reporting a sense of profound connection and understanding with the hypothetical\nalien entities, while others experienced confusion, disorientation, or even a sense of moral outrage. These findings underscore the complexity and unpredictability of interstellar relations, and highlight\nthe need for a nuanced and multi-faceted approach to the development of a shared moral framework\nfor human-alien diplomacy. These analyses involved\nthe application of theoretical frameworks from fields such as cognitive science, anthropology, and\nphilosophy, and aimed to shed light on the deeper structural and existential implications of the research\nfindings. The results of these analyses are presented in the following sections, and are intended to\ncontribute to a broader conversation about the nature and significance of Bayesian Theology for\nExtra-Terrestrial Diplomacy. 5 Results\nThe investigation into the probability of shared moral frameworks with alien civilizations has yielded\na plethora of intriguing results, warranting a nuanced and multifaceted examination. These simulations revealed a fascinating pattern of results, wherein the predicted probability of shared\nmoral frameworks exhibited a non-linear relationship with the distance between civilizations. Specifi-\ncally, our findings suggest that the likelihood of convergent moral values increases exponentially as\nthe distance between civilizations decreases, up to a critical threshold of approximately 10 parsecs. In addition to these findings, our investigation has also uncovered a range of unexpected and seemingly\nanomalous results, which challenge our current understanding of Bayesian inference in the context\nof interstellar diplomacy. For instance, our simulations have revealed that the incorporation of\n\"quantum fluctuations\" into the IMA model can significantly enhance the predicted probability of\nshared moral frameworks, particularly in scenarios where civilizations are separated by vast distances. To further elucidate the complex relationships between these variables, we have constructed a\ncomprehensive table summarizing the key results of our simulations, as shown below:\nTable 2: Simulation Results for Interstellar Moral Alignment\nSimulation ID Distance (parsecs) MSI Value Predicted Probability Quantum Fluctuations\nSIM-001 5 0.8 0.75 No\nSIM-002 10 0.6 0.4 Yes\nSIM-003 15 0.4 0.2 No\nSIM-004 20 0.2 0.1 Yes\nSIM-005 25 0.1 0.05 No\nSIM-006 30 0.05 0.01 Yes\nThe data presented in this table highlights the complex interplay between variables such as distance,\nMSI value, and quantum fluctuations, and underscores the need for further research into the underlying\nmechanisms governing the emergence of shared moral frameworks. In a surprising twist, our analysis has also revealed a fascinating connection between the probability\nof shared moral frameworks and the presence of certain types of celestial bodies in a given star system. Specifically, we have found that the presence of a gas giant planet in the habitable zone of a star is\nstrongly correlated with a increased probability of shared moral values amongst the intelligent species\ninhabiting that system. One of the most interesting results of this research is the discovery of\na \"moral singularity\" - a point at which the moral framework of an alien civilization becomes so\ncomplex and nuanced that it is effectively incomprehensible to human observers. In addition to these findings, our research has also touched on a number of more speculative and\nphilosophical topics, including the possibility of a \"multiverse of moralities\" - a vast ensemble of\nparallel universes, each with its own unique moral framework and set of moral principles. 10",
        "Conclusion": "Ultimately, this study pushes the boundaries of interdisciplinary inquiry,\nproviding a rigorous, nuanced framework for addressing the moral complexities of\ninterstellar cooperation while challenging our assumptions about humanity\u2019s place\nin the universe. Ultimately,\nthe development of a Bayesian theological framework for extra-terrestrial diplomacy will require a\nmultidisciplinary approach, one that draws on insights from theology, philosophy, astrobiology, and\neconomics to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex moral and ethical issues at play. In conclusion, the exploration of Bayesian theology and its application to extra-terrestrial diplomacy\nrepresents a fascinating and complex area of inquiry, one that challenges our existing understanding\nof morality, ethics, and the cosmos. In conclusion, our research has yielded a rich tapestry of results, replete with unexpected twists\nand tantalizing prospects for future investigation. 6 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, our exploration of Bayesian Theology for Extra-Terrestrial Diplomacy has yielded a\nplethora of intriguing insights into the potential for shared moral frameworks with alien civilizations.

        "Abstract": "Detecting and Summarizing Video Highlights with\nLag-Calibration\nAbstract\nThe increasing popularity of video sharing has led to a growing need for automatic\nvideo analysis, including highlight detection. 3 Problem Formulation\nThe problem addressed in this paper can be formulated as follows: The input consists of a set of\ntime-synchronized comments, denoted as C={c1, c2, c3, . The sixth emotion category, \"disgust,\" is omitted due\nto its rarity in the dataset but can be easily incorporated for other datasets. Concept Mapping\nTo tackle semantic sparsity in time-synchronized comments and build lexical chains of semantically\nrelated words, we first map words with similar meanings to the same concept.",
        "Methodology": "Emerging platforms that feature\ncrowdsourced, time-synchronized video comments offer a valuable resource for\nidentifying video highlights. However, this task presents several challenges: (1)\ntime-synchronized comments often lag behind their corresponding shots; (2) these\ncomments are frequently sparse and contain noise semantically; and (3) determining\nwhich shots constitute highlights is inherently subjective. This paper introduces\na novel framework designed to address these challenges. The proposed method\nuses concept-mapped lexical chains to calibrate the lag in comments, models\nvideo highlights based on comment intensity and the combined concentration\nof emotion and concept within each shot, and summarizes detected highlights\nusing an enhanced SumBasic algorithm that incorporates emotion and concept\nmapping. Experiments conducted on extensive real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat our highlight detection and summarization methods substantially outperform\nexisting benchmark techniques. However, extracting highlights from a video is a complex task. The absence of high-level semantic\ninformation poses a significant limitation to highlight detection in conventional video processing. These real-time comments, which\nappear overlaid on the video screen, are synchronized with the video frames. The prevalence of time-synchronized comments offers a\nunique opportunity for leveraging natural language processing in video highlight detection. Nevertheless, using time-synchronized comments for highlight detection and labeling still poses\nsignificant challenges. Primarily, there is an almost unavoidable delay between comments and their\ncorresponding shots. As illustrated in Figure 1, discussions about a particular shot may continue\ninto subsequent shots. Highlight detection and labeling without accounting for this lag may yield\ninaccurate outcomes. The defining characteristics of highlights must be clearly defined, captured, and modeled to ensure\naccurate detection. To our knowledge, limited research has focused on unsupervised highlight detection and labeling\nusing time-synchronized comments. The most relevant work in this area proposes detecting highlights\nbased on the topic concentration derived from semantic vectors of bullet-comments, and labeling each\nhighlight using a pre-trained classifier based on predefined tags. However, we contend that emotion\nconcentration holds greater significance than general topic concentration in highlight detection. Another study suggests extracting highlights based on the frame-by-frame similarity of emotion\ndistributions. However, neither of these approaches addresses the combined challenges of lag\ncalibration, balancing emotion-topic concentration, and unsupervised highlight labeling. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes the following solutions: (1) employ word-to-\nconcept and word-to-emotion mapping based on global word embedding, enabling the construction of\nlexical chains for calibrating the lag in bullet-comments; (2) detect highlights based on the emotional\nand conceptual concentration and intensity of the lag-calibrated bullet-comments; and (3) summarize\nhighlights using a modified Basic Sum algorithm that considers emotions and concepts as fundamental\nunits within a bullet-comment. It\u2019s important to note that highlight detection differs\nfrom video summarization. While video summarization aims to provide a condensed representation\nof a video\u2019s storyline, highlight detection focuses on extracting its emotionally impactful content. However,\ndue to the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics, the accuracy of highlight\ndetection based solely on video processing is limited. This study models highlight detection as a simpler two-objective optimization problem with specific\nconstraints. However, the features employed to assess the \"highlightness\" of a shot diverge from\nthose used in the aforementioned studies. Instead, our focus is on modeling\nemotional and topic concentration within the context of this study. These approaches involve manual labeling and supervised training,\n2temporal and personalized topic modeling, or tagging the video as a whole. One work proposes\ngenerating a summarization for each shot through data reconstruction that jointly considers textual\nand topic levels. One work proposed a centroid-diffusion algorithm to identify highlights. Additionally, they utilize predefined labels to train a classifier for\nhighlight labeling. The current study differs from these two studies in several ways. First, before\nperforming highlight detection, we apply a lag-calibration step to mitigate inaccuracies caused\nby comment delays. Second, we represent each scene using a combination of topic and emotion\nconcentration. Third, we perform both highlight detection and labeling in an unsupervised manner. 2.4 Lexical chain\nLexical chains represent sequences of words that exhibit a cohesive relationship spanning multiple\nsentences. Subsequent research expanded lexical chains by\nincorporating WordNet relations and word sense disambiguation. This study constructs\nlexical chains for accurate lag calibration, leveraging global word embedding. , t n}for a given video v. We are also given a compression\nratio\u03c1highlight that determines the number of highlights to be generated, and a compression ratio\n\u03c1summary that specifies the number of comments to be included in each highlight summary. , s m}, and (2)\nto produce highlight summaries \u03a3(v) ={C1, C2, C3, . Each highlight summary Cicomprises a subset of the comments associated with that shot:\nCi={c1, c2, c3, . The number of highlight shots mand the number of comments in each\nsummary kare determined by \u03c1highlight and\u03c1summary , respectively. 4 Video Highlight Detection\nThis section introduces our proposed framework for detecting video highlights. We also describe\ntwo preliminary tasks: constructing a global word embedding for time-synchronized comments and\nbuilding an emotion lexicon. , (wn:vn)},\nwhere wiis a word, viis its corresponding word vector, and nis the vocabulary size of the corpus. Therefore, we construct\nan emotion lexicon tailored for time-synchronized comments, derived from the word-embedding\n3dictionary generated in the previous step. We begin by manually labeling words corresponding to\nthe five basic emotion categories (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and surprise) as seeds, selecting\nfrom the most frequent words in the corpus. A neighbor is added to the seeds if it meets a minimum percentage of overlap \u03b8overlap with all seeds,\nwith a minimum similarity score of simmin. Neighbors are determined based on cosine similarity\nwithin the word-embedding space. 4.2 Lag-Calibration\nThis section details our method for lag calibration, which involves concept mapping, constructing\nword-embedded lexical chains, and performing the actual calibration. Given a set of\ncomments Cfor a video v, we define a mapping Ffrom the vocabulary VCof comments Cto a set of\nconcepts KC:\nF:VC\u2192 KC(|VC| \u2265 |K C|)\nSpecifically, the mapping Fassigns each word wito a concept k=F(wi)as follows:\nF(wi) =F(w1) =F(w2) =. .=F(wtop_n) =k,\u2203k\u2208 KC\ns.t. {w|w\u2208top_n(wi)\u2227 F(w) =k}/|top_n(wi)| \u2265\u03b8overlap\ntop_n(wi)returns the nnearest neighbors of word wibased on cosine similarity. For each word wi\nin the comments C, we examine the percentage of its neighbors that have already been mapped to\na concept k. If this percentage exceeds the threshold \u03b8overlap , then word wiand its neighbors are\nmapped to concept k. Otherwise, they are assigned to a new concept, represented by wiitself. Lexical Chain Construction\nThe next step involves constructing all lexical chains present in the time-synchronized comments for\nvideo v. This enables the calibration of lagged comments based on these chains. A lexical chain lik\nconsists of a set of triples lik={(w, t, c )}, where wis the actual word mentioned for concept kin\ncomment c, and tis the timestamp of comment c. We create a lexical chain dictionary LCfor the\ntime-synchronized comments Cof video v:\nLC={k1: (l11, l12, l13, . ), k2: (l21, l22, l23, . , k n: (ln1, ln2, ln3, . Specifically, each comment in Ccan either be appended to an existing lexical chain or added to a\nnew, empty chain. This decision is based on the comment\u2019s temporal distance from existing chains,\ncontrolled by the maximum silence parameter tsilence . However, we argue that these lexical chains remain useful\nbecause our concept mapping is built from time-synchronized comments in their natural order. This continuity, combined with global word embedding, ensures the validity of our\nconcept mapping in most scenarios. Our observations indicate that the initial comment pertaining to a\nshot typically occurs within that shot, while subsequent comments may not. Therefore, we adjust\nthe timestamp of each comment to match the timestamp of the first element within its corresponding\nlexical chain. If a comment belongs to multiple lexical chains (concepts), we select the chain with the\nhighest score score chain . The score chain is calculated as the sum of the frequencies of each word\n4in the chain, weighted by the logarithm of their global frequencies, denoted as log(D(w).count ). Consequently, each comment will be assigned to its most semantically significant lexical chain\n(concept) for calibration. It\u2019s worth noting that if multiple consecutive shots, {s1, s2, . , s n}, contain comments with similar\ncontent, our lag-calibration method might shift many comments from shots s2, s3, . , s nto the\ntimestamp of the first shot, s1, if these comments are connected through lexical chains originating\nfrom s1. This is not necessarily a drawback, as it helps us avoid selecting redundant consecutive\nhighlight shots and allows for the inclusion of other potential highlights, given a fixed compression\nratio. 4.3 Shot Importance Scoring\nIn this section, we first segment comments into shots of equal temporal length, denoted as tshot. We\nthen model the importance of each shot, enabling highlight detection based on these importance\nscores. A shot\u2019s importance is modeled as a function of two factors: comment concentration and commenting\nintensity. Therefore, our model combines these two types of concentration. We define the emotional\nconcentration Cemotion (Cs)of shot sbased on time-synchronized comments Csand the emotion\nlexicon Eas follows:\nCemotion (Cs) = 1\u2212P|E|\ne=1pelog(pe)\npe=|{w|w\u2208Cs\u2227w\u2208E(e)}|\n|Cs|\nHere, we calculate the inverse of the entropy of probabilities for the five emotions within a shot to\nrepresent emotion concentration. Next, we define topical concentration Ctopic as:\nCtopic(Cs) =1\nJPJ\nj=1pjlog(pj)\npj=P\nw\u2208Cs\u2229F(kj)1\nlog(D(w))P\nw\u2208Cs1\nlog(D(w))\nwhere we calculate the inverse of the entropy of all concepts within a shot to represent topic\nconcentration. The probability of each concept kis determined by the sum of the frequencies of\nits mentioned words, weighted by their global frequencies, and then divided by the sum of these\nweighted frequencies for all words in the shot. Now, the comment importance Icomment (Cs, s)of shot scan be defined as:\nIcomment (Cs, s) =\u03bb\u00b7Cemotion (Cs, s) + (1 \u2212\u03bb)\u00b7Ctopic(Cs, s)\nwhere \u03bbis a hyperparameter that controls the balance between emotion and concept concentration. , s m}for video v, each associated with\nits lag-calibrated comments Cs, our goal is to generate summaries \u03a3(v) ={C1, C2, C3, . This two-level updating approach achieves two key objectives:\n(1) it penalizes the selection of sentences containing semantically similar words, and (2) it allows for\nthe selection of a sentence with a word already present in the summary if that word occurs significantly\nmore frequently. Additionally, we introduce an emotion bias parameter, bemotion , to weight words\nand concepts during probability calculations. This increases the frequencies of emotional words and\nconcepts by a factor of bemotion compared to non-emotional ones. All datasets and\ncode will be made publicly available on Github. Crowdsourced Time-sync Comment Corpus\nTo train the word embedding described earlier, we collected a large corpus of time-synchronized\ncomments from Bilibili, a content-sharing website in China that features such comments. On average, each comment contains 7.20 tokens. Before training, each comment undergoes tokenization using the Chinese word tokenization package\nJieba. The word embedding is trained using word2vec with the skip-gram model. We set the number of\nembedding dimensions to 300, the window size to 7, and the down-sampling rate to 1e-3. Words with\na frequency lower than 3 are discarded. Emotion Lexicon Construction\nAfter training the word embedding, we manually select emotional words belonging to the five basic\nemotion categories from the 500 most frequent words in the embedding. We then iteratively expand\nthese emotion seeds using Algorithm 1. After each expansion iteration, we manually review the\nexpanded lexicon, removing any inaccurate words to prevent concept drift. The filtered expanded\nseeds are then used for further expansion in the next round. The minimum overlap \u03b8overlap is set to\n0.05, and the minimum similarity simminis set to 0.6. These values are determined through a grid\nsearch within the range of [0, 1]. Video Highlights Data\nTo evaluate our highlight detection algorithm, we constructed a ground-truth dataset. We then consider the most\nfrequently selected highlights as the ground truth for a given video. For each video, 3-4 video mix-clips are collected from Bilibili. These highlights are mapped to\nthe original video timeline, and their start and end times are recorded as ground truth. Mix-clips are\nselected based on the following criteria: (1) they are found on Bilibili using the search query \"video\ntitle + mixed clips\"; (2) they are sorted by play count in descending order; (3) they primarily focus on\nvideo highlights rather than a plot-by-plot summary or gist; (4) they are under 10 minutes in length;\nand (5) they contain a mix of several highlight shots instead of just one. For each highlight\nshot and its associated comments, we asked annotators to create a summary by selecting as many\ncomments as they deemed necessary. The guiding principles were: (1) comments with identical\nmeanings should not be selected more than once; (2) the most representative comment among similar\ncomments should be chosen; and (3) comments that stand out and are irrelevant to the current\ndiscussion should be discarded. Video Highlight Detection Evaluation\nTo evaluate video highlight detection, we need to define a \"hit\" between a candidate highlight and a\nreference highlight. A strict definition would require a perfect match between the start and end times\nof the candidate and reference highlights. However, this criterion is overly stringent for any model. A more lenient definition would consider an overlap between a candidate and a reference highlight. However, this can still underestimate model performance, as users\u2019 choices of highlight start and end\ntimes can sometimes be arbitrary. Instead, we define a \"hit\" with a relaxation parameter \u03b4between a\ncandidate hand the reference set Ras follows:\nhit(h, R) ={1\u2203r\u2208R: (sh, eh)\u2229(sr\u2212\u03b4, er+\u03b4)\u0338=\u2205\n0otherwise\nwhere sh,ehrepresent the start and end times of highlight h, and\u03b4is the relaxation length applied to\nthe reference set R. We can then define precision, recall, and F1-score as:\nPrecision (H, R) =P\nh\u2208Hhit(h,R)\n|H|\nRecall (H, R) =P\nr\u2208Rhit(r,H)\n|R|\nF1(H, R) =2\u00b7Precision (H,R )\u00b7Recall (H,R )\nPrecision (H,R )+Recall (H,R )\nIn this study, we set the relaxation length \u03b4to 5 seconds. The candidate highlight length is set to 15\nseconds. First, a\nnaive precision metric would be biased towards shorter comments, and BLEU mitigates this with the\nBP(Brevity Penalty) factor:\nBLEU \u2212n(C, R) =BP\u00b7P\nc\u2208CP\nn\u2212gram\u2208cCount clip(n\u2212gram )P\nc\u2208CP\nn\u2212gram\u2208cCount (n\u2212gram )\nBP={1if|C|>|R|\ne(1\u2212|R|/|C|)if|C| \u2264 |R|\nwhere Cis the candidate summary and Ris the reference summary. Second, while the reference\nsummary contains no redundancy, the candidate summary might incorrectly select multiple similar\ncomments that match the same keywords in the reference. In such cases, precision would be\nsignificantly overestimated. BLEU addresses this by counting matches one-by-one; the number of\nmatches for a word will be the minimum of its frequencies in the candidate and reference summaries. Finally, the F1-score is defined as:\nF1\u2212n(C, R) =2\u00b7BLEU \u2212n(C,R )\u00b7ROUGE \u2212n(C,R )\nBLEU \u2212n(C,R )+ROUGE \u2212n(C,R )\n6.3 Benchmark methods\nBenchmarks for Video Highlight Detection\nFor highlight detection, we compare different combinations of our model against three benchmark\nmethods:\n* **Random-Selection:** Highlight shots are randomly selected from all shots in a video. *\n**Uniform-Selection:** Highlight shots are selected at equal intervals. * **Spike-Selection:** High-\nlight shots are chosen based on the highest number of comments within the shot. * **Spike+E+T:**\nThis is our method, incorporating emotion and topic concentration but without lag calibration. *\n**Spike+L:** This is our method, including only the lag-calibration step and not considering content\nconcentration. Benchmarks for Video Highlight Summarization\nFor highlight summarization, we compare our method against five benchmark methods:\n* **SumBasic:** Summarization that relies solely on frequency for summary construction. * **Latent\nSemantic Analysis (LSA):** Text summarization based on singular value decomposition (SVD)\nfor latent topic discovery. * **KL-Divergence:**\nSummarization based on minimizing KL-divergence between the summary and the source corpus,\nemploying a greedy search approach. The parameter \u03bb, which controls the balance\nbetween emotion and concept concentration, is set to 0.9. A detailed parameter analysis is provided\nin Section 7. Table 4 presents the precision, recall, and F1-scores for different combinations of our method and the\nbenchmark methods. Our full model (Spike+L+E+T) outperforms all other benchmarks across all\nmetrics. However, not all comment-intensive shots are highlights. In contrast, our method can identify less intensive but emotionally\nor conceptually concentrated shots that might be missed by spike-selection. Table 5 compares the 1-gram BLEU, ROUGE, and F1-scores of our method and the benchmark\nmethods. Our method outperforms all others, particularly in terms of ROUGE-1. LSA exhibits the\nlowest BLEU score, primarily because it statistically favors longer, multi-word sentences, which are\nnot representative in time-synchronized comments. The SumBasic method also performs relatively\npoorly, as it treats semantically related words separately, unlike our method, which uses concepts\ninstead of individual words. We introduce a lag-calibration technique\nthat re-aligns delayed comments to their corresponding video scenes by using concept-mapped\nlexical chains. Video highlights are identified based on comment intensity and the concentration\nof concepts and emotions within each shot. For summarization, a two-level SumBasic is proposed\nwhich updates word and concept probabilities iteratively when selecting sentences. Future work\nincludes integrating additional data sources such as video meta-data, audience profiles, and low-level\nmulti-modal features.",
        "Results and Findings": "This surge in video sharing has intensified the demand for efficient\nvideo analysis. Automatically generated highlights would enable\nusers to digest the video\u2019s key moments in a matter of minutes, aiding their decision on whether to\nwatch the full video later. Furthermore, automated video highlight detection and summarization can\nsignificantly enhance video indexing, search, and recommendation systems. Secondly, time-synchronized comments are often semantically sparse, both\nin terms of the number of comments per shot and the number of words per comment. This sparsitycan hinder the performance of traditional bag-of-words statistical models. The main contributions of this research are as follows: (1) We introduce a completely unsupervised\nframework for detecting and summarizing video highlights using time-synchronized comments;\n(2) We introduce a lag-calibration method that uses concept-mapped lexical chains; (3) We have\ncreated extensive datasets for bullet-comment word embedding, an emotion lexicon tailored for\nbullet-comments, and ground-truth data for evaluating highlight detection and labeling based on\nbullet-comments. 2 Related Work\n2.1 Highlight detection by video processing\nFollowing the definition from previous research, we define highlights as the most memorable shots in\na video characterized by high emotional intensity. Given that highlight shots are observed to correlate with\nhigh emotional intensity and topic concentration, coverage and non-redundancy are not primary\noptimization goals, as they are in temporal text summarization. Shots are represented by\nlatent topics found through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Another method suggests using pre-\ntrained semantic vectors of comments to cluster them into topics and subsequently identify highlights\nbased on topic concentration. Early work on lexical chains used syntactic relationships of words from Roget\u2019s Thesaurus,\nwithout considering word sense disambiguation.

It\u2019s important to note that word senses within the constructed lexical chains are not disambiguated,\nunlike in most traditional algorithms.

This dataset\nleverages user-uploaded mixed-clips related to a specific video on Bilibili. On average, each video contains 24.3 highlight shots. Highlights Summarization Data\nWe also created a highlight summarization (labeling) dataset for the 11 videos. Across the 11 videos and 267 highlights, each highlight has an average of 3.83 comments in its\nsummary. BLEU is chosen for two reasons. * **Luhn method:** A heuristic summarization method that\nconsiders both word frequency and sentence position within an article. 6.4 Experiment Results\nThis section presents the experimental results for both highlight detection and highlight summariza-\ntion. Results of Highlight Detection\nIn our highlight detection model, the maximum silence threshold for lexical chains, tsilence , is set\nto 11 seconds. Additionally, spike-selection tends to cluster highlights within consecutive\nshots with high comment volumes. We also observe that lag calibration alone (Spike+L) considerably enhances the performance of\nSpike-selection, partially supporting our hypothesis that lag calibration is crucial for tasks involving\ntime-synchronized comments.

        "Abstract": "Enhancing Deep Reinforcement Learning with\nPlasticity Mechanisms\nAbstract\nThe objective of this research is to address the phenomenon of plasticity loss in\ndeep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, where neural networks lose their ability\nto learn effectively over time. ?",
        "Methodology": "Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or hyperparameter\ntuning, which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability. This approach offers a more\nefficient and adaptable solution compared to existing methods. Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or\nhyperparameter tuning, which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability [3]. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution compared\nto existing methods. The core idea behind plasticity injection is to dynamically adjust the learning\ncapacity of the neural network based on its current learning progress and the complexity of the\nenvironment. This adaptive approach contrasts with traditional methods that either maintain a fixed\nnetwork architecture or employ computationally intensive retraining procedures. We hypothesize\nthat by carefully monitoring the agent\u2019s learning trajectory and selectively injecting plasticity where\nneeded, we can significantly improve the long-term performance and robustness of RL agents. This\ntargeted approach minimizes unnecessary computational overhead and avoids the potential negative\nconsequences of over-parameterization. Furthermore, our framework provides valuable insights into\nthe underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, contributing to a deeper understanding of this critical\nissue in RL. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for\nidentifying the onset and severity of plasticity loss within an RL agent. This diagnostic capability\nallows for proactive intervention before performance degradation becomes significant. By continuously monitoring this metric, we can detect early signs of plasticity loss and\ntrigger the plasticity injection mechanism. Second, plasticity injection mitigates plasticity loss without requiring an increase in the number of\ntrainable parameters or alterations to the network\u2019s prediction capabilities. This ensures that the\ncomputational overhead remains minimal while maintaining the integrity of the learned policy. This is\nachieved by selectively modifying the learning rates of specific neurons or layers within the network,\n.rather than adding new parameters. This targeted approach allows us to fine-tune the network\u2019s\nplasticity without disrupting its overall functionality. The selection of neurons or layers is guided by\nthe diagnostic framework, ensuring that plasticity injection is focused on the areas of the network\nthat are most affected by plasticity loss. Third, the method dynamically expands network capacity only when necessary, leading to improved\ncomputational efficiency during training. This adaptive capacity allocation avoids unnecessary\nresource consumption during periods of stable performance. This dynamic capacity expansion is\nachieved by adding new neurons or layers only when the diagnostic framework indicates a significant\ndecline in the agent\u2019s adaptability. This ensures that the network\u2019s complexity remains minimal\nduring periods of stable performance, reducing computational overhead and preventing overfitting. The specific mechanism for dynamic capacity expansion is detailed in Section 4. The effectiveness of plasticity injection is evaluated across a range of challenging RL benchmarks,\nincluding continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. Its ability to diagnose, mitigate, and adapt to the challenges of plasticity loss without substantial\ncomputational overhead makes it a promising approach for deploying RL agents in real-world\napplications. Future research will focus on extending the framework to more complex scenarios and\nexploring its integration with other advanced RL techniques. Several approaches have been proposed to address this challenge, but they often\nsuffer from limitations in terms of computational efficiency or generalizability. These methods often involve significant changes to the network architecture, leading to\nincreased computational complexity and potential instability. Another line of research has explored the use of regularization techniques to improve the stability\nand plasticity of RL agents [6, 7]. These methods typically involve adding penalty terms to the\nloss function, encouraging the network to maintain a certain level of plasticity. However, the\nchoice of regularization parameters can be crucial and often requires careful tuning, which can\nbe computationally expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, the effectiveness of regularization\ntechniques can vary significantly depending on the specific RL algorithm and environment. More recently, there has been a growing interest in meta-learning approaches for improving the\nadaptability of RL agents [8, 9]. These methods aim to learn a general-purpose learning algorithm\nthat can quickly adapt to new tasks or environments. While meta-learning techniques have shown\npromising results in certain scenarios, they often require significant computational resources for\ntraining the meta-learner. Furthermore, the performance of meta-learning methods can be sensitive to\nthe choice of meta-learning algorithm and the design of the meta-training process. Our proposed plasticity injection framework differs from these existing approaches in several key\naspects. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for identifying the onset and severity of plasticity\nloss, allowing for proactive intervention. Second, it mitigates plasticity loss without requiring\nsignificant architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. Third, it dynamically expands\nnetwork capacity only when necessary, leading to improved computational efficiency. These features\nmake plasticity injection a more efficient and adaptable solution compared to existing methods for\naddressing plasticity loss in RL. The unique combination of diagnostic capabilities, targeted plasticity\nadjustments, and adaptive capacity allocation distinguishes our approach from previous work. 2This deeper understanding of the causes of plasticity loss is crucial for designing more robust and\nadaptable RL agents. Our work contributes to the broader field of continual learning and aims to\nadvance the state-of-the-art in building truly resilient and long-lasting RL agents. 3 Methodology\nOur proposed approach, termed \"plasticity injection,\" addresses plasticity loss in deep reinforcement\nlearning agents through a three-pronged strategy: diagnosis, mitigation, and adaptive capacity\nexpansion. The core of our methodology lies in a novel diagnostic metric that continuously monitors\nthe agent\u2019s learning trajectory and adaptability. Early detection is crucial, allowing for proactive intervention before significant\nperformance degradation occurs. The computational efficiency of this metric is paramount, ensuring\nminimal disruption to the overall training process. We employ a sliding window approach to smooth\nout short-term fluctuations in the metric, enhancing its robustness to noise and providing a more\nreliable signal for intervention. The threshold for triggering plasticity injection is dynamically\nadjusted based on the agent\u2019s performance history, adapting to the inherent variability of different\nRL environments. This adaptive thresholding prevents premature or unnecessary interventions,\noptimizing the efficiency of our approach. The diagnostic framework forms the foundation upon\nwhich the subsequent mitigation and capacity expansion strategies are built. The mitigation strategy focuses on targeted adjustments to the network\u2019s learning dynamics, rather\nthan wholesale architectural changes. Instead of adding new parameters, we selectively modify\nthe learning rates of specific neurons or layers identified by the diagnostic framework as being\nmost affected by plasticity loss. This targeted approach minimizes computational overhead while\npreserving the integrity of the learned policy. We employ a gradient-based optimization technique to\ndetermine the optimal learning rate adjustments for each identified neuron or layer. This optimization\nprocess considers both the current learning progress and the agent\u2019s overall performance, ensuring\nthat the adjustments are both effective and stable. The learning rate adjustments are implemented\nusing a dynamic scaling factor, which is continuously updated based on the diagnostic metric. This\ndynamic scaling ensures that the plasticity injection mechanism adapts to the evolving needs of the\nagent throughout the training process. The specific algorithm for determining the optimal learning\nrate adjustments is detailed in Appendix A.\nAdaptive capacity expansion is triggered only when the diagnostic metric indicates a significant\nand persistent decline in the agent\u2019s adaptability, despite the mitigation efforts. This ensures that\ncomputational resources are not wasted on unnecessary capacity increases during periods of stable\nperformance. The capacity expansion is implemented by adding new neurons or layers to the network,\nstrategically placed based on the information provided by the diagnostic framework. The addition of\nnew neurons or layers is guided by a principled approach that minimizes disruption to the existing\nnetwork architecture and ensures seamless integration of the new capacity. We employ a gradual\nexpansion strategy, adding a small number of neurons or layers at a time, to avoid sudden changes\nthat could destabilize the training process. The specific architecture of the added neurons or layers\nis determined based on the nature of the plasticity loss detected by the diagnostic framework. This\ntargeted expansion ensures that the added capacity is effectively utilized to address the specific\nchallenges posed by plasticity loss. The effectiveness of plasticity injection is rigorously evaluated across a diverse set of challenging\nRL benchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. These\nbenchmarks are carefully selected to represent a wide range of complexities and challenges commonly\nencountered in real-world applications. Our methodology contributes significantly to the field of continual learning by providing a novel and\nefficient approach to address plasticity loss in RL agents. The combination of proactive diagnosis,\n3targeted mitigation, and adaptive capacity expansion allows for a robust and adaptable system that\nmaintains high performance over extended periods. The insights gained from this research pave the\nway for more resilient and long-lasting RL agents, crucial for deploying these agents in complex and\ndynamic real-world scenarios. Future work will focus on extending the framework to handle even\nmore complex environments and integrating it with other advanced RL techniques. These benchmarks were carefully selected to represent a broad spectrum of complexities\nand challenges commonly encountered in real-world applications. The selection criteria included the\npresence of significant plasticity loss in baseline agents, the diversity of task structures, and the com-\nputational feasibility of extensive training runs. Our experiments focused on assessing the long-term\nperformance and learning stability of agents trained using plasticity injection, compared to several\nstate-of-the-art baselines. These baselines included methods based on architectural modifications,\nregularization techniques, and meta-learning approaches, each representing a distinct strategy for\naddressing plasticity loss in RL. The comparative analysis allowed us to rigorously evaluate the\nadvantages and limitations of our proposed framework. Our experimental setup involved training multiple agents for each benchmark using different methods:\nplasticity injection, and three state-of-the-art baselines (Baseline A, Baseline B, and Baseline C). Each agent was trained for a fixed number of timesteps, allowing for a direct comparison of their\nlong-term performance and learning stability. Performance was evaluated using standard metrics\nappropriate for each benchmark, such as average cumulative reward, success rate, and learning curves. Learning curves were generated by plotting the average reward obtained over a sliding window\nof timesteps, providing a clear visualization of the learning progress and stability of each agent. Statistical significance was assessed using paired t-tests, comparing the performance of plasticity\ninjection against each baseline. The significance level was set at \u03b1= 0.05.

The diagnostic component of our framework also provided valuable insights into the underlying\nmechanisms of plasticity loss, revealing patterns in neuronal activity and learning rate dynamics that\nwere correlated with performance degradation. The ability to\nproactively diagnose, mitigate, and adapt to the challenges of plasticity loss without substantial\ncomputational overhead makes it a promising approach for deploying RL agents in real-world\napplications. Future research will focus on extending the framework to more complex scenarios,\nexploring its integration with other advanced RL techniques, and investigating the scalability of\n4the diagnostic metric to larger and more complex neural networks. Specifically, CCT1\nand CCT2 involved controlling simulated robotic arms to achieve specific goals, while POE1 and\nPOE2 presented partially observable scenarios requiring the agent to infer hidden states from limited\nsensory information. The selection criteria included the presence of significant plasticity loss in\nbaseline agents, the diversity of task structures, and the computational feasibility of extensive training\nruns. Our experiments focused on assessing the long-term performance and learning stability of\nagents trained using plasticity injection, compared to three state-of-the-art baselines (Baseline A,\nBaseline B, and Baseline C). These baselines represented distinct strategies for addressing plasticity\nloss, including architectural modifications, regularization techniques, and meta-learning approaches. The comparative analysis allowed for a rigorous evaluation of the advantages and limitations of our\nproposed framework. The experimental setup involved training multiple agents for each benchmark using each of the four\nmethods. Each agent was trained for 1 million timesteps, allowing for a direct comparison of their\nlong-term performance and learning stability. Performance was evaluated using standard metrics\nappropriate for each benchmark, including average cumulative reward, success rate, and learning\ncurves. Learning curves were generated by plotting the average reward obtained over a sliding\nwindow of 10,000 timesteps, providing a clear visualization of the learning progress and stability of\neach agent. Statistical significance was assessed using paired t-tests, comparing the performance of\nplasticity injection against each baseline. The significance level was set at \u03b1= 0.05. The diagnostic component of our framework also provided valuable insights\ninto the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, revealing patterns in neuronal activity and learning\nrate dynamics that were correlated with performance degradation. The ability to proactively diagnose, mitigate, and adapt to the challenges of plasticity loss\nwithout substantial computational overhead makes it a promising approach for deploying RL agents\nin real-world applications. Future work will focus on extending the framework to more complex scenarios, exploring its\nintegration with other advanced RL techniques, and investigating the scalability of the diagnostic\n5metric to larger and more complex neural networks. The insights gained from this research contribute\nto a broader understanding of neural network plasticity and its implications for the development of\nmore robust and adaptable AI systems. Unlike existing methods\nthat often rely on computationally expensive architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning,\nplasticity injection offers a more efficient and adaptable solution. Our approach operates on three\nkey principles: proactive diagnosis of plasticity loss, targeted mitigation without increasing trainable\nparameters, and dynamic capacity expansion only when necessary. This three-pronged strategy\nensures minimal computational overhead while maintaining the integrity of the learned policy and\noptimizing resource utilization. This deeper\nunderstanding is crucial for designing more robust and adaptable AI systems. The targeted mitigation\nstrategy, focusing on selective learning rate adjustments rather than architectural changes, ensures\nminimal disruption to the learned policy. The dynamic capacity expansion mechanism further\noptimizes resource utilization by adding capacity only when absolutely necessary. This adaptive\napproach contrasts sharply with traditional methods that either maintain a fixed network architecture\nor employ computationally intensive retraining procedures. The insights gained from this research contribute significantly to the broader field of continual\nlearning and the development of more robust and adaptable AI systems. Future research\nwill focus on extending the framework to even more complex scenarios, exploring its integration with\nother advanced RL techniques, and investigating its scalability to larger and more complex neural\nnetworks. Its efficiency, adaptability, and ability to provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of\nplasticity loss make it a promising approach for deploying RL agents in real-world applications. The\nconsistent improvements in performance and stability across diverse benchmarks strongly support the\nefficacy and robustness of our proposed framework. We believe that plasticity injection represents a\nsignificant step forward in building truly resilient and long-lasting AI systems.",

        "Abstract": "Acquiring the Ability to Recommend Interventions for Tuberculosis\nTreatment Through the Utilization of Digital Adherence Information\nAbstract\nDigital Adherence Technologies (DATs) are becoming progressively favored as a means of confirming patients\u2019\nadherence to various medications. This observation does not imply that individuals who miss doses are more inclined\nto take medication, but rather suggests that an intervention by a health worker likely occurred, after which the patient resumed their\nmedication. Typically, this represents a last resort for health workers when patients are unresponsive to alternative\nmethods. Given the increasing adoption of DAT systems for TB, HIV , diabetes, heart disease, and other medications, this work aims to\nestablish the groundwork for enhanced patient outcomes in healthcare settings worldwide.",
        "Methodology": "This research establishes the basis for deriving insights from this real-world\ndata, encompassing a methodology to circumvent the influence of unrecorded interventions in the training\ndata employed for machine learning. To address the issue of non-adherence, the WHO advocates for directly observed treatment (DOT),\nwherein a healthcare professional directly observes and validates a patient\u2019s daily intake of the necessary medication. Consequently, digital adherence technologies (DATs), which offer patients adaptable methods to\ndemonstrate adherence, have experienced a surge in popularity on a global scale. Healthcare professionals can subsequently\nmonitor patient adherence in real-time using a dashboard. Besides enhancing patient adaptability and confidentiality, the dashboard\nempowers healthcare personnel to categorize patients and allocate their constrained resources towards those at the highest risk. The WHO has even issued a manual for the effective incorporation\nof this technology in TB patient care. In this paper, the focus is on investigating how the extensive longitudinal data generated by DATs can be utilized to assist health\nworkers in better triaging TB patients and providing interventions to enhance the overall adherence of their patient group. The data\nunder analysis originates from Mumbai, India, and is the result of a collaboration with the City TB Office of Mumbai. They have\nput into practice a DAT that enables patients to verify their adherence by making daily toll-free calls. Everwell provides\nsupport for the implementation of 99DOTS across India, where there were an estimated 2.7 million cases of TB in 2017. In Mumbai,\npatients registered in 99DOTS currently receive interventions based on the following broad guidelines. If they have not taken their\nmedication by the afternoon, they (and their health worker) get a text message reminder. If the patient still does not take their\nmedication after some time, the worker will call the patient directly. Therefore, models that can pinpoint patients at risk of missing doses and\nprioritize interventions by health workers are of the utmost importance. Provided with information regarding a patient\u2019s medication adherence as indicated by their calls to the 99DOTS system, it is\npossible to train a machine learning model to forecast whether they will miss medication doses in the future. Therefore, to prescribe interventions, it\u2019s necessary to separate the impact of manual interventions from other underlying elements\nthat contribute to missed doses. An added difficulty is that healthcare workers\nseldom document their interventions within the 99DOTS system, making it hard to gauge their consequences. Although there is a\nsubstantial body of research on assessing heterogeneous treatment effects, conventional methods consistently necessitate awareness\nof which patients underwent an intervention. To facilitate the provision of enhanced care, it is imperative that\nwe can glean insights from this complex yet abundant data. Hence, a general strategy is introduced for acquiring knowledge from adherence data with unrecorded interventions, grounded in\ndomain expertise regarding the intervention heuristics used by healthcare workers. A proxy is created for interventions evident in\nthe historical 99DOTS data, and a model is devised to aid in prioritizing intervention targets for healthcare workers across various\nclinical scenarios. 2 Methodology\nThe TB treatment system functions under severe resource constraints; for instance, a single health worker might be in charge of\nover 100 patients. Therefore, it is essential that workers can precisely evaluate patient risk and prioritize interventions appropriately. Although machine learning can be employed to carry out such risk assessment with encouraging precision, it necessitates careful\nconsideration of how intervention resources were distributed in the current data. A significant obstacle arises from the fact that users of the 99DOTS platform typically do not document interventions. Although far from perfect, these gaps are unavoidable as countries with varying reporting\nstandards adopt DATs for TB treatment. This\nchallenge is subsequently addressed by developing a screening procedure that recognizes patients who were probable candidates for\nspecific interventions. The aim is to utilize the accessible data to create an approximation for when an intervention likely took place, enabling the training\nof models on data points unaffected by interventions. The initial step involves differentiating between various categories of health\nworker interventions. Specifically, a house visit is regarded as a \"resource-limited\" intervention, given that workers are unable to visit\nall their patients promptly. On the other hand, calls and texts are viewed as \"non-resource-limited\" interventions, as they could feasibly be conducted\non a large patient population at minimal expense. To develop the proxy, a search was conducted for health worker guidelines concerning house visits. The 2005 guide by India\u2019s\nRevised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) mandated that workers perform a house visit after a single missed dose. However, more recent guidelines are considerably more ambiguous on this matter. Both the latest guide by the WHO and the\nRNTCP leave house visits to the health worker\u2019s discretion. Consequently, the proxy\nwas formulated based on the adherence dashboard accessible to health workers. Initially, if a patient has a record in the Patient\nLog, signifying that a provider made a note about the patient within the preceding 7 days, their status is automatically adjusted to\n\"MEDIUM\" attention. The remaining 99% of labels are determined as\nfollows: if a patient misses 0 or 1 doses in the past 7 days, their attention level is changed to \"MEDIUM.\" If they miss 4 or more, it\nis changed to \"HIGH.\" As a conservative proxy, it\nwas assumed that only \"HIGH\" attention patients were candidates for resource-limited interventions, considering that the attention\nlevel serves as a health worker\u2019s primary overview of recent patient adherence. This \"Attention Required\" system for screening\nresource-limited interventions is applicable to any daily adherence context; one only needs to ascertain the threshold for a change to\nHIGH attention. 2Employing this screening system, sequences of days can be identified during which a patient was a candidate for a resource-limited\nintervention, and subsequently, the use of signal from those days in the training task can be avoided. 3 Experiments\nThe objective was to create a model that mirrors the daily routine of a health worker, which involves analyzing their patients\u2019 recent\ncall records to gauge adherence risk and subsequently planning various types of interventions. Enhanced prediction capabilities\nenable workers to engage with a greater number of patients proactively, prior to their missing crucial doses. The process began with the entire group of 16,975 patients and proceeded to create training samples from each patient in the\nfollowing manner. All consecutive sequences of 14 days of call data were considered, ensuring that the initial 7 days of each\nsequence did not overlap. The first 7 days of each patient\u2019s treatment, as well as the final day, were omitted to prevent any bias that\nmight arise from interactions with health workers during the initiation or conclusion of treatment. Two filtering steps were then\nimplemented. Initially, samples were excluded where the patient had in excess of 2 doses manually recorded by a provider during the\ninput sequence, as these patients likely had contact with their provider outside of the 99DOTS system. Secondly, samples in which\nthe patient did not miss any doses in the input sequence were removed. Although these samples constituted the majority of the data,\nthey included almost no positive (HIGH risk) labels, which distorted the training process. Each sample comprised a time-series of call data along with static characteristics. The time series encompassed two sequences of 7\nin length for every sample. The initial sequence was a binary representation of call data, where 1 signified a call or manual dose\nand 0 indicated a miss. The subsequent sequence represented a cumulative count of all doses missed up to that specific day, taking\ninto account the patient\u2019s entire history within the program. Supplementary features were derived from the patient Call\nLogs and captured a patient\u2019s behavior beyond mere adherence. For instance, did the patient call at a consistent time each morning\nor at irregular intervals throughout the day? This was captured by calculating the mean and variance of the call minute and hour. Additional features encompassed the number of calls, number of manual doses, and the mean, maximum, and variance of calls per\nday, in addition to days per call. Analogous features were also incorporated, which exclusively utilized unique calls per day (i.e.,\ncalls to distinct phone numbers) or disregarded manual doses. This procedure resulted in 29 descriptive features. Initially, standard models were tested that utilize solely the static features: linear regression, a random forest (with 100 trees and a\nmaximum depth of 5), and a support vector machine. To make use of the time series data, a deep network was also constructed, designated as LEAP (Lstm rEal-time\nAdherence Predictor), which accepts both the time series and static features as input. LEAP comprises two input layers: 1) an LSTM\nwith 64 hidden units for the time series input, and 2) a dense layer with 100 units for the static feature input. The outputs of these\ntwo layers were concatenated and fed forward into another dense layer with 16 units, followed by a single sigmoid activation unit. A\nbatch size of 128 was employed, and training was conducted for 20 epochs. To assess the models, all data was randomized, and 25% was set aside as the test set. To address class imbalance, SMOTE was utilized to oversample the training set, implemented using\nthe Python library imblearn. Features were also normalized as percentiles using SKLearn, which was empirically found to be\neffective. The benchmark for comparison was the method employed by the current 99DOTS platform to evaluate risk, namely, doses\nmissed by the patient in the preceding week (lw-Misses). Nevertheless, to gauge the efficacy of the methods relative to the baseline, a comparison is made regarding how each method\ncould be applied to strategize house-visit interventions. Given that this constitutes a highly constrained resource, the most stringent\nbaseline threshold was established to contemplate patients for this intervention, specifically, 3 missed calls. To ascertain the number of missed\ndoses caught, only missed doses that transpired before the patient\u2019s transition to HIGH risk are counted. This proves advantageous for interventions not constrained by resources, like calls or texts. It\nis important to remember that the screening procedure is not pertinent to this category of intervention; therefore, the predictions\ncan solely advocate for supplementary interventions. It is crucial that additional interventions are meticulously aimed, as repeated\nengagement with a specific patient diminishes the effectiveness of each subsequent interaction over time. Nonetheless, these\nadvancements cannot be realized unless health workers on the ground administer interventions in accordance with the predictions. Consequently, interpretability emerges as a crucial determinant of the model\u2019s utility, as health workers must comprehend the\nrationale behind the model\u2019s predictions to trust it and incorporate its logic with their own professional expertise. The superior predictive performance was attained with LEAP, a black-box network, as opposed to an inherently interpretable model\nsuch as linear regression. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) python library was employed, which produces\nvisualizations to elucidate machine learning models. It is illustrated how static features affect the model\u2019s prediction, where red\nfeatures drive predictions toward 1 (HIGH) and blue toward 0 (MEDIUM). It is important to recall that features are scaled as\npercentiles. Conversely, in the red region, it is noted that this patient has a very low average but a high variability in time\nbetween calls. The model learned that this is a high-risk behavior. Four distinct samples are presented as input to the LSTM layer of the model. On the right, SHAP values corresponding to each\nday of adherence data are displayed, and grey denotes the commencement of the call sequence. It is observed that the model has\ndiscerned that calls made later in the week carry more weight than those made earlier. This visualization method offers intuitive insights into the principles acquired by the model. A comprehensive strategy is formulated for learning from medical adherence data that includes unrecorded\ninterventions, and this strategy is utilized to construct a model for forecasting risk in various contexts. Subsequently, the model is trained for outcome prediction, illustrating how adherence data can more accurately detect patients\nat risk of unfavorable treatment outcomes. The learning\nmethodologies presented here are versatile and could be applied to analyze data generated by DATs for any medication schedule. Conventional studies on TB treatment typically model outcomes solely in relation to patient covariates, such as demographic\ncharacteristics. It is important to note\nthat intervention effects are still discernible in this configuration. The prediction task is formalized in the following manner: given the first k days of adherence data, predict the final binary treatment\noutcome. Furthermore, given that patients with the outcome \"Died\" or \"Lost to follow-up\" exit the program prior to the full 6\nmonths of treatment, those who were present for less than k + 1 days were excluded. This was inclined to enhance prediction performance, which is conjectured to be\nassociated with the observation that practices for reporting manual doses varied by health center, rendering the \"significance\" of a\nmanual dose ambiguous across samples with respect to outcome. Through discussions in Mumbai, it was learned that health workers often build a sense of a patient\u2019s risk of an unfavorable outcome\nwithin their first month of treatment. To model this process, k=35 was set for the prediction task, capturing the first month of each\npatient\u2019s adherence after enrollment in 99DOTS. (Note that this is not a general rule for health workers, but simply served as a\n4motivation for the choice of k in this task.) Two versions of the health worker baseline were included: missed\ndoses in the last week (lw-Misses) and total missed doses in 35 days (t-Misses). The same models, grid search design, training process, and evaluation procedure as before were used. For LEAP, 64 hidden units were used for the LSTM input layer, 48 units for the dense\nlayer input, and 4 units in the penultimate dense layer. Even the rudimentary baseline of tallying the calls made in the preceding 7 days before the 35-day threshold is somewhat predictive\nof the outcome, implying that the daily data provided by DATs is valuable in assessing which patients will fail TB treatment. The\nML models exhibit even greater predictive capability, with LEAP leading in performance, closely followed by the random forest. 7 Detecting Low-Call Favorable Outcome Patients\nAn additional significant hurdle within the 99DOTS system is that certain patients consistently take their doses as directed but opt not\nto call. Consequently, according to the dashboard, they appear to be missing doses and would be categorized as HIGH risk by both\n99DOTS and LEAP. However, in actuality, they should be classified as MEDIUM risk. The aim is to learn to recognize these LCFO patients to avoid\nincorrectly classifying them as HIGH risk, despite their lack of calls. Additionally, there is a desire to identify these patients early in\ntheir treatment so they can be reassigned to an adherence monitoring method that is more appropriate for them. This is framed as a binary prediction task as follows: given the first k days of adherence data, predict whether the patient will both\ncall on less than 25% of days from day k + 1 onward and have a favorable outcome. Only patients who were assigned an outcome as\nin Section 3 and who had at least k + 7 days of adherence data were included. To detect LCFO status as early as possible, k was set\nto 7. The health worker baseline of missed doses in the last week (lw-Misses) was included, along with a random forest\ntrained only on demographic or \"0-day\" data (RF 0-day), a simple baseline that counts the number of manual doses in the last week\n(lw-Manual), a random forest trained on all non-sequence features over the initial 7 days (RF), and LEAP trained on all features and\nsequences. The same models, grid search design, training process, and evaluation procedure as the previous two formulations were used. For LEAP, 200\nhidden units were used for the LSTM input layer, 1000 units for the dense layer input, and 16 units in the penultimate dense layer. Interestingly, for this task, the lw-Misses baseline has almost no predictive power. Conversely, the performance of the lw-Manual\nheuristic is notable, which simply counts the number of manual doses marked in the first 7 days for each patient. This insight merits closer inspection by supervisors about why\npatients in certain regions tend to be disengaged with 99DOTS but still consuming pills. The RF and LEAP models both perform\nslightly better than the lw-Manual baseline but similarly to each other, suggesting that the adherence sequence structure does not\nencode additional information for this prediction task. To realize this end-to-end\ntraining, recent developments in decision-focused learning are employed, which incorporates an optimization model within the\nmachine learning training loop. Nonetheless, it is underscored that the system can be readily adapted to\naccommodate other intervention problems. Such adaptability is one of the advantages of the technical approach, which permits the\nML model to automatically adjust to the problem delineated by a domain expert. Visiting a\nlocation enables the health worker to intervene with any of the patients at that location. Firstly, it gauges the degree to which the health worker can proactively engage with patients before adherence declines. Secondly, this objective exclusively counts patients who commence the week at MEDIUM attention and receive an intervention\nbefore they could have transitioned to HIGH, aligning with the earlier discussion on circumventing unobserved interventions in the\ndata. This extends the earlier intervention proxy to manage day-by-day rewards. There is a set of locations i= 1, . , N ,\nwhere patient jhas location \u2113j. Over the days of the week t= 1, . The decision variable is xit, which takes the value 1 if the health worker visits location\nion day tand 0 otherwise. Here, the second constraint prevents the objective from double-counting multiple visits to a location. \u03c4= 1 was used as it performed best. Secondly, the LEAP system was trained directly on the true cjtas a binary prediction task using cross-entropy loss. Thirdly, LEAP\nwas trained to predict cjtusing performance on the above optimization problem as the loss function (training via the differentiable\nsurrogate). All patients were included, even those with no missed\ndoses in the last week, since the overall resource allocation problem over locations must still account for them. To investigate what specifically distinguishes the\npredictions made by LEAP-Decision, scatter plots of the predicted utility at each location according to LEAP and LEAP-Decision\nversus the true values are presented. Hence, decision-focused training incentivizes the model to focus on making accurate predictions specifically for locations\nthat are likely to be good candidates for an intervention. This demonstrates the benefit of the flexible machine learning modeling\napproach, which can use custom-defined loss functions to automatically adapt to particular decision problems. *Doses per patient was calculated only on patients enrolled at least 6 months before Sept 2018.",
        "Results and Findings": "This paper examines the information gathered from a city that utilizes 99DOTS,\na telephone-based DAT implemented for tuberculosis (TB) treatment in India, where approximately 3 million\nindividuals are diagnosed with the disease annually. The dataset encompasses approximately 17,000 patients\nand 2.1 million dosage records. Subsequently, a deep learning model is developed, its interpretability is\nillustrated, and it is demonstrated how it can be modified and trained under diverse clinical conditions to more\neffectively target and enhance patient treatment. In the context of real-time risk prediction, the model could be\nemployed to proactively intervene with 21% more patients and prevent 76% more missed doses compared to\nthe current heuristic benchmarks. Regarding outcome prediction, the model exhibits 40% improvement over\nbaseline approaches, enabling cities to allocate more resources to clinics with a higher proportion of patients\nsusceptible to treatment failure. The widespread occurrence of TB is partially attributable\nto inadequate adherence to medication, which leads to an elevated probability of mortality, reinfection, and the development of\ndrug-resistant strains of TB. Initial research indicates that DATs have the potential to enhance adherence in various disease contexts, thereby stimulating their\nutilization and assessment for the management of TB adherence. However, because this data was gathered through a wide-ranging implementation involving actual\npatients, it incorporates the impacts of interventions executed by healthcare personnel. Nevertheless, through discussions in Mumbai, it was discerned that\nhealth workers give precedence to non-adherent patients for resource-limited interventions like house visits. However, this guideline impacts fewer than 1% of the labels. Patients with 2-3 missed doses maintain their attention level from the day before. Moreover, positive predictions for patients\nwho missed 0 doses are improbable to be beneficial; no resource-limited intervention can be implemented so extensively that patients\nwith flawless recent adherence are targeted. The aforementioned steps yielded 16,015 samples, of which 2,437 were positive. The random forest exhibited the best performance, so the others are omitted for\nthe sake of clarity. A 4-fold grid search was employed to ascertain\nthe optimal model parameters. Maintaining the FPR of\nthis baseline method, it is demonstrated how many more patients in the test set would be reached weekly by the proposed method\n(owing to its enhanced TPR), alongside the enhancement in the quantity of missed doses detected. The model identifies 21.6%\nmore patients and captures 76.5% more missed doses, signifying substantially more accurate targeting than the baseline. It is shown that the model also surpasses the baseline as both the true positive rate (TPR) and FPR escalate, underscoring the model\u2019s\nsuperior discriminatory capability. This emphasizes the\nsignificance of the enhanced precision provided by the model, as merely inundating the entire population with calls and texts is\nprobable to be ineffective. 3The model has the capability to prevent a greater number of missed doses compared to existing approaches. In the blue region, it is observed that this patient makes an above-average number of calls each week, pushing the\nprediction toward 0. These features capture that this patient missed two days of calls, then made three calls on one day in an attempt to\n\"back log\" their previous missed calls. In a real-world application, healthcare\nprofessionals could produce these visualizations for any given sample on-the-fly to support their decision-making procedure. In the real-time adherence\nscenario, it is demonstrated that the model would empower health workers to more precisely direct interventions to high-risk patients\nat an earlier stage, identifying 21% more patients and preventing 76% more missed doses than the existing heuristic benchmark. Insights are then derived that could assist health workers in accurately identifying\nLCFO patients using a straightforward rule after a mere 7 days of treatment. By utilizing daily real-time adherence data furnished by DATs, an exploration is conducted into how employing\nthe initial k days of a patient\u2019s adherence facilitates more precise, individualized outcome predictions. \"Cured\" and \"Treatment Complete\" were regarded as favorable outcomes, while \"Died,\" \"Lost to follow-up,\" and\n\"Treatment Failure\" were considered unfavorable. The final dataset comprised 4167 samples, with 433 unfavorable\ncases. For instance, suppose Mumbai initiates a new program to capture 80% of unfavorable outcomes (true positives)\nby recruiting additional health staff. Across the 17,000 patients in Mumbai, where 10% have unsuccessful outcomes as in the test\nset, an 80% capture rate necessitates rescuing 1360 patients. Employing either baseline, attaining the 80% TPR necessitates an FPR\nof 70%, which translates to hiring extra staff to support 10710 total patients in this hypothetical scenario. However, utilizing LEAP\nonly results in an FPR of 42%, corresponding to 6426 total patients. With a yearly starting salary of |216,864, the model would result in |37M in saved costs\nannually. This simple\nheuristic has almost equivalent predictive power to the machine learning models. This is a valuable insight for health workers,\nsuggesting that if the worker is already manually marking doses for a patient early in their treatment, the patient is likely to continue\nto be disengaged with the system in the long term and should be considered for different adherence technology. These insights could improve processes by 1) helping to identify hotspot\nregions of LCFO patients, after which supervisors might investigate the underlying reason and adjust treatment accordingly at those\ncenters and 2) the lw-Manual baseline, after only 7 days of dosage data, could give health workers a simple rule for identifying\nLCFO patients that should switch to different adherence technology. . . . . . . , 7, the objective coefficient cjtis 1 if an intervention on day t\nwith patient jis successful and 0 otherwise. It is noted that the feasible\nregion of the LP can be demonstrated to be equivalent to a bipartite matching polytope, implying that the optimal solution is always\nintegral. Quantitatively, LEAP-Decision\u2019s predictions have worse correlation with the ground truth\noverall (0.463, versus 0.519 for LEAP), but better correlation on locations where the true utility is strictly more than 1 (0.504 versus\n0.409).

        "Methodology": "This paper presents a novel approach to 3D protein structure\nprediction, leveraging a bespoke ensemble of convolutional neural networks and\nrecurrent neural networks to capture the intricate relationships between amino\nacid sequences and their corresponding 3D conformations. Notably, our methodol-\nogy incorporates an unconventional component: a generative model trained on a\ndataset of protein structures inspired by the fractal patterns found in Romanesco\nbroccoli, which intuitively captures the self-similar properties of protein folds. However, determining the 3D structure of a\nprotein experimentally can be a time-consuming and costly process, making it essential to develop\ncomputational methods that can accurately predict protein structures. Recently, deep learning techniques have emerged as a promising approach for protein structure\nprediction, leveraging large datasets of known protein structures to train neural networks that can\npredict the 3D coordinates of amino acids in a protein. These methods have shown remarkable\naccuracy in certain cases, but they are not without their limitations. For instance, some studies have\nreported that deep learning models can be biased towards predicting structures that are similar to\nthose in the training dataset, rather than exploring the full range of possible conformations. One intriguing approach that has been proposed to address this limitation is the use of generative\nmodels to sample from the vast space of possible protein structures. This involves training a neural\nnetwork to generate new protein structures that are similar in structure and function to known proteins,\nbut with subtle variations that could potentially lead to new biological insights. In addition to their potential for predicting protein structures, deep learning models have also\nbeen used to analyze and visualize the complex patterns and relationships that exist within protein\nmolecules. By exploring\nthe intricate networks and patterns that exist within protein molecules, researchers hope to gain a\ndeeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie human disease, and to develop new\ntherapeutic strategies for treating a wide range of disorders. As researchers\ncontinue to explore the potential of these methods, it is likely that we will see new and innovative\napproaches emerge, some of which may seem unexpected or even bizarre, but which could ultimately\nlead to major breakthroughs in our understanding of protein biology and function. 2 Related Work\nDeep learning has revolutionized the field of 3D protein structure prediction, enabling accurate\nmodeling of complex molecular interactions that underlie various diseases. Notably, the application of generative adversarial networks has shown promise in generating\nnovel protein sequences with desired structural properties, potentially leading to the discovery of new\ntherapeutics. One intriguing approach involves the use of transfer learning, where pre-trained models are fine-tuned\non smaller, disease-specific datasets to predict protein structures associated with particular pathologies. Furthermore, the\nincorporation of auxiliary information, such as protein-ligand binding affinities and gene expression\nprofiles, has enhanced the predictive power of these models, facilitating a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of protein function and its relationship to disease. This endeavor has led to the development of innovative algorithms that\ncan generate protein sequences capable of thriving in extreme environments, such as high-temperature\nor high-pressure conditions. While the practical implications of this research are still unclear, it has\nsparked interesting discussions about the potential for life on other planets and the possibility of\nusing protein engineering to create novel, extraterrestrial life forms. Moreover, an unconventional approach has been proposed, which involves using protein structure\nprediction as a means of generating musical compositions. By mapping protein sequences to musical\nnotes and using predicted structures to inform the composition of melodies, researchers have created\na novel form of protein-inspired music. Ultimately, the development of accurate and efficient methods for 3D protein structure prediction\nremains an active area of research, with significant implications for the field of drug discovery. As researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, it is likely that we will see\nthe emergence of novel, innovative approaches that challenge our current understanding of protein\nstructure and function, and potentially lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of complex diseases. 3 Methodology\nThe development of deep learning models for 3D protein structure prediction has been a pivotal\naspect of advancing drug discovery. To tackle this complex problem, we employed a multi-faceted\napproach, combining elements of computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement\nlearning. Our methodology commenced with the creation of a novel dataset, comprising protein\nstructures represented as 3D voxel grids, which were then translated into a musical composition. The musical compositions were generated using a custom-designed algorithm, which assigned specific\nnotes and melodies to different amino acid sequences and structural motifs. These compositions\nwere then fed into a deep neural network, trained to predict the 3D structure of the protein based\non the musical representation. The network architecture consisted of a series of convolutional and\nrecurrent layers, which learned to identify patterns and relationships between the musical notes and\nthe corresponding protein structure. In addition to this primary approach, we also explored the use of an auxiliary model, trained on\na dataset of protein structures paired with their corresponding smells. To further augment our model, we incorporated a reinforcement learning component, which allowed\nthe network to explore different conformational spaces and discover novel protein structures. Throughout the development of our methodology, we prioritized creativity and experimentation, often\nventuring into uncharted territory and exploring unconventional approaches. While some of these\napproaches may have seemed illogical or flawed at the outset, they ultimately contributed to a deeper\nunderstanding of the complex relationships between protein structure, function, and prediction. Our\nmethodology serves as a testament to the power of innovative thinking and the importance of pushing\nthe boundaries of what is thought to be possible in the field of deep learning for 3D protein structure\nprediction. 4 Experiments\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our AI-assisted restoration approach, we conducted a series of\nexperiments on a dataset of medieval Gothic architectural structures. We divided the dataset into training and testing sets,\nwith 400 images used for training and 100 images used for testing. Our approach utilized a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze\nthe images and predict the original architecture of the buildings. We employed a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) to extract features from the images, which were then used to train a generative\nmodel to produce restored versions of the buildings. The generative model was trained using a novel\n3loss function that took into account not only the visual similarity between the restored and original\nbuildings but also the historical and cultural context of the architecture. In addition to the standard approach, we also explored the use of unconventional methods to enhance\nthe restoration process. One such approach involved using a swarm of drones equipped with tiny\nchisels to physically carve out the restored architectural features from foam blocks. The drones were\nprogrammed to work in tandem with the AI system, using the predicted architecture as a guide to\ncarve out the intricate details of the buildings. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it allowed\nus to explore the potential of using robotic systems to physically realize the restored architecture. This approach also allowed us to test the\nrestorations in a more engaging and interactive way, providing a more comprehensive understanding\nof the buildings\u2019 original architecture. By leveraging a unique blend of computer vision\nand machine learning algorithms, our system was able to accurately identify and reconstruct damaged\nor missing structural elements, such as vaulted ceilings, ribbed arches, and flying buttresses. Notably,\nour approach incorporated an unconventional methodology, wherein the AI system was trained on\na dataset of Gothic architecture-inspired fractal patterns, which enabled it to develop a profound\nunderstanding of the underlying geometric and aesthetic principles that govern these structures. Furthermore, our system\u2019s capacity for adaptive learning allowed it to\nincorporate feedback from human experts, thereby refining its restoration proposals and ensuring that\nthey aligned with the highest standards of historical authenticity and architectural coherence. In addition to its technical merits, our AI-assisted\nrestoration framework also demonstrated a surprising ability to evoke emotional responses in human\nobservers, who consistently reported feeling a sense of awe, wonder, and connection to the past when\ninteracting with the restored structures. By leveraging machine learning\nalgorithms and computer vision techniques, it is possible to recreate and restore damaged or destroyed\narchitectural elements with unprecedented accuracy. One potential approach to this problem involves\ntraining a neural network on a dataset of intact Gothic structures, allowing it to learn the underlying\npatterns and styles that define the genre. This trained network could then be used to generate\nrestoration proposals for damaged buildings, taking into account factors such as the original materials,\nconstruction techniques, and aesthetic sensibilities of the medieval architects. Ultimately, the key to successful AI-assisted restoration of medieval Gothic architecture will be to\nstrike a balance between preserving the historical integrity of the buildings and allowing for innovative\nand creative solutions to the challenges posed by their restoration. By embracing the possibilities\noffered by artificial intelligence, while also respecting the cultural and historical significance of these\nstructures, it may be possible to create restorations that are not only accurate and authentic, but also\nvibrant and dynamic, reflecting the needs and sensibilities of contemporary society. This collaborative approach can help to ensure that the restored\nbuildings are not only historically accurate but also culturally sensitive and relevant to the needs of the\nlocal population. Additionally, the use of AI can help to streamline the restoration process, reducing\ncosts and increasing efficiency, while also allowing for the creation of detailed digital models and\nsimulations of the restored buildings, which can be used for educational and tourist purposes. As the technology continues to evolve and improve, it is likely that we will see the emergence of new\nand innovative approaches to restoration, which will allow us to preserve and protect these incredible\nbuildings for generations to come.",
        "Results and Findings": "By\nintegrating this unorthodox element, our model achieves state-of-the-art perfor-\nmance on benchmark datasets, while also demonstrating an unexpected capacity\nfor predicting protein structures that defy conventional notions of biochemical\nplausibility, such as a predicted structure resembling a miniature replica of the\nEiffel Tower. Interestingly, some\nresearchers have even explored the use of chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz attractor, to introduce\nrandom fluctuations into the structure prediction process, with the goal of escaping local minima and\nexploring more diverse regions of the conformational space.Furthermore, the application of deep learning to protein structure prediction has also led to some\nunexpected and bizarre discoveries. For example, one study found that a neural network trained to\npredict protein structures could also be used to generate novel musical compositions, by mapping\nthe 3D coordinates of amino acids onto musical notes and rhythms. Recent studies have\ndemonstrated the efficacy of recurrent neural networks in predicting protein secondary structure,\nwhile others have leveraged convolutional neural networks to identify functional sites on protein\nsurfaces. This strategy has yielded impressive results, particularly in the context of amyloidogenic diseases,\nwhere accurate structure prediction can inform the design of targeted therapies. In a surprising turn of events, researchers have also explored the application of protein structure\nprediction to the field of xenobiology, where the goal is to design novel, non-natural proteins with\nunique functional properties.

        "Methodology": "The\ncompetition sought methods for addressing motion prediction in cross-domain\nscenarios. The method proposed features a novel\narchitecture utilizing a self-attention mechanism and a specifically designed loss\nfunction. Ultimately, this approach achieved 3rd place in the competition. Predicting vehicle\ntrajectories to generate control commands is essential for avoiding collisions. While deep learning\nhas shown promise in specific domains, real-world conditions, such as varying environments, weather,\nand driver behaviors, create challenges for models trained on single datasets. These models may not\nperform well across diverse datasets. The goal was\nto predict 25 timestamps of trajectories from given raster images. The feature extractor was modified using NFNet\nfor stability, and a self-attention layer was included to enhance time-related predictions. Given input raster images X that contain the first 5 seconds of vehicle data, the\nobjective is to predict the last 5 seconds of trajectories Y for the objects. [width=0.8]./Recurrent model.png\nFigure 1: Base Model Architecture: The baseline model uses the backbone model to extract features\nand utilizes recurrent model to generate prediction according to latent vectors. BC models the autoregressive likelihood as a single-variate\nGaussian, while DIM uses a multivariate normal distribution. After assessing the performance of BC\nand DIM, BC was selected as the baseline due to its better performance. The BC method is broken\ndown into two components: the feature extraction backbone and the recurrent model. Z=f(X) (1)\nThe baseline applies MobileNetV1 as its backbone. MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 were also\nconsidered but produced worse results, likely due to the simplicity of input data and model complexity. Ultimately, the NFNet was chosen as the backbone (feature extractor) because of its training stability. Self-Attention Layer To further refine the raster image features, a self-attention layer was in-\ncorporated. The feature map was divided into pixel groups, and\nself-attention was used to aggregate pixel-wise information. Recurrent Model The GRU model was selected for the recurrent component due to superior\nperformance compared to other models. Using the embedding from feature extraction as hidden\nstates, the recurrent model makes predictions recursively. Given the embedding Zt at time t, with the\noutput vector Y0 as zero vector, the recurrent model g is used to generate predictions:\nZt=gencoder (Yt\u22121, Zt\u22121) (2)\nYt=gdecoder (Yt\u22121, Zt) (3)\nWhere Yt\u2208RB\u00d7T\u00d72represents the vehicle\u2019s position on a 2D bird\u2019s-eye-view map, and Zt\u2208RB\u00d7K\nrepresents the hidden vector. 2.2 Loss Function\nThe model was initially trained using negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss. However, because of the\ninadequate performance of the model on Average Distance Error (ADE) and Final Distance Error\n(FDE), these metrics were added to minimize the distance between predicted and actual positions. In the equation, the first component is the original loss, the\nsecond is the ADE loss, and the last is the FDE loss. 2.3 Ensemble Method\nTo improve performance, the Robust Imitative Planning (RIP) method was employed to combine\nseveral models. The\ntraining set contains 27036 scenes, and the testing set contains 9569 scenes. FDE calculates the sum of squared errors of\nthe final positions. NLL measures the unlikelihood of predicted trajectories matching the actual ones. Input feature maps were resized to 128 x 128. The AdamW optimizer and gradient\nclipping with a value of 1.0 was used. The baselines selected were\nDIM and BC. Adding a self-attention mechanism improved the\nresults. Although the DIM method resulted in the lowest Negative Log Likelihood(NLL), it was not as\ncompetitive as other models. The WCM method samples multiple predictions\nper model and picks the one with the lowest confidence for more reliable results. Overall, this approach secured 3rd\nplace. This methodology resulted in the third prize in the competition.",

        "Abstract": "Enhancing Urban Crop Cultivation Using\nDrone-Based Swarm Strategies: A Sociobiological\nApproach to Automated Pollination\nAbstract\nThis paper presents a groundbreaking exploration of the intersection between urban\nfarming, insect-inspired swarm robotics, and sociobiology, with a particular focus\non the intriguing phenomenon of drone dance rituals.",
        "Methodology": "By drawing inspiration\nfrom the complex social behaviors of insects, such as the mesmerizing waggle\ndances of honeybees, we propose a novel approach to augmenting urban farming\npractices through the deployment of swarm robotics. By leveraging the\ncollective intelligence of swarm systems, farmers can create more efficient and adaptive farming\nmethods, akin to the complex social structures exhibited by certain insect species. The rhythmic movements and choreographed manoeuvres performed\nby these drones serve as a form of non-verbal communication, conveying vital information about crop\nhealth, soil quality, and optimal harvesting strategies. Ultimately, the fusion of insect-inspired swarm robotics and urban farming practices has the\npotential to create a new paradigm for sustainable food production, one that is characterized by a\ndeeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all living systems. A key aspect of this approach is the\ndevelopment of drone swarm systems that mimic the complex social behaviors of insects, such as\nbees and ants, to optimize farm management and maintenance. While the exact mechanisms underlying\nthis phenomenon are still not fully understood, researchers speculate that the dance rituals may have\nenabled the drones to develop a shared cognitive framework, allowing them to coordinate their actions\nand adapt to their environment in a more effective manner. This approach involves the use of chemical signals, similar to those used by insects,\nto facilitate communication and coordination among drones. Nevertheless, the\npotential benefits of this approach, including the ability to facilitate complex social behaviors and\nadapt to changing environmental conditions, make it an intriguing area of research that warrants\nfurther exploration. Interestingly, some researchers have also proposed the use of insect-inspired swarm robotics in con-\njunction with other unconventional approaches, such as the incorporation of plant-based intelligence\nand the use of fungal mycelium as a basis for swarm coordination. While these approaches may\nseem unorthodox, they reflect the growing recognition that the development of truly autonomous\nand adaptive swarm systems will require the incorporation of novel and innovative solutions, often\n2inspired by the complex and fascinating behaviors exhibited by certain insect species. 3 Methodology\nTo investigate the potential of insect-inspired swarm robotics in augmenting urban farming, we\nemployed a multidisciplinary approach, combining sociobiological principles with robotics and\nartificial intelligence. Our methodology involved designing and developing a swarm of drones that\nwould mimic the dance rituals of insects, such as bees and butterflies, to optimize crop pollination\nand monitoring. The development of the drone swarm was informed by a thorough analysis of insect social behavior,\nincluding the study of colony dynamics, communication protocols, and decision-making processes. By incorporating these princi-\nples into our drone design, we aimed to create a swarm that could adapt to changing environmental\nconditions and optimize its performance in real-time. One of the key innovations of our approach was the inclusion of a \"virtual queen\" drone, which\nserved as the central hub for the swarm\u2019s communication and coordination. This signal was designed to mimic the chemical cues used by real insect\nqueens to regulate the behavior of their colonies. To further enhance the swarm\u2019s performance, we introduced a novel \"insect-inspired\" navigation sys-\ntem, which utilized a combination of GPS, lidar, and \"sniffing\" algorithms to mimic the navigational\ncues used by insects. This system allowed the drones to create detailed maps of their environment\nand navigate through complex spaces with ease. The\nrobots were programmed to mimic the complex social behaviors of insects, such as communication,\ncooperation, and adaptability, to optimize crop yields and reduce resource waste. This was achieved through the integration of a random number generator and\na machine learning algorithm that enabled the robots to learn from their environment and adapt to\nnew situations. To further explore the sociobiological aspects of drone dance rituals, the researchers conducted a\nseries of experiments involving human participants. In an effort to elucidate the underlying dynamics governing these phenomena, a series of simulations\nwere conducted, incorporating elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry. By studying the complex communication patterns and collective behaviors exhibited by\ninsects, we have developed a novel framework for designing and deploying swarm robotic systems\nthat can enhance crop yields, reduce pesticide use, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it highlights the potential for interdisciplinary research\nto uncover novel insights and connections between seemingly disparate fields. These circular patterns, which are formed by the interactions of\nmultiple robots and plant species, have been observed to exhibit properties that are reminiscent\nof self-organized criticality, whereby the system spontaneously generates complex patterns and\nbehaviors that are not predetermined by the individual components. While this may seem like a tangential pursuit, it highlights\nthe potential for interdisciplinary research to unlock new forms of creativity and innovation that can\nhave far-reaching impacts on society. By embracing this uncertainty and fostering a\nspirit of interdisciplinary collaboration, we can unlock new possibilities for innovation and discovery\nthat can help us navigate the complexities of the 21st century.",
        "Results and Findings": "Our research reveals that the\nintroduction of drone dance rituals, characterized by intricate patterns of movement\nand communication, can have a profound impact on crop yields, soil quality, and\neven the local microclimate. Perhaps surprisingly, our findings suggest that the\ndrones\u2019 dance rituals can also influence the emergence of collective intelligence\nin urban farming systems, leading to unexpected outcomes such as the sponta-\nneous formation of drone-based \"cults\" that prioritize the optimization of tomato\nplant growth over other crops. Furthermore, our study sheds light on the bizarre\nphenomenon of \"drone telepathy,\" where individual drones appear to develop a\nform of extrasensory perception, allowing them to anticipate and respond to the\nneeds of their human operators in ways that defy logical explanation. Through a\nsociobiological lens, we examine the implications of these findings for the future\nof urban farming, highlighting the potential benefits and challenges of integrating\ninsect-inspired swarm robotics into existing agricultural practices, and exploring\nthe uncharted territories where technology, nature, and human culture converge. Recent studies have shown that the incorporation of drone dance rituals, inspired by the mesmerizing\npatterns exhibited by bees and other insects, can significantly enhance the efficacy of swarm robotics\nin urban farming applications. Furthermore, the spectacle of these drone dance\nrituals has been observed to have a profound impact on the psychological well-being of farmers,\nfostering a sense of wonder and awe that can lead to improved job satisfaction and reduced stress\nlevels. In a bizarre twist, researchers have discovered that the drones\u2019 dance patterns can also influence\nthe growth and development of crops, with certain sequences of movements seeming to stimulate\nincreased photosynthetic activity and nutrient uptake. The sociobiological implications of these findings are profound, suggesting that the introduction of\ninsect-inspired swarm robotics into urban farming ecosystems can have far-reaching consequences for\nthe entire food chain. As we continue to explore the intricacies of drone dance rituals and their role\nin facilitating plant-drone symbiosis, we may uncover new and innovative methods for optimizing\ncrop yields, improving soil quality, and promoting ecological balance. One notable study explored the application of drone dance rituals in a urban farming setting, where\na swarm of drones was programmed to perform a choreographed dance routine inspired by the\nmating rituals of the peacock spider. The results showed that the drones were able to adapt to\nchanging environmental conditions and optimize crop yields, despite the lack of any discernible\nlogical connection between the dance rituals and the farming tasks. Furthermore, the study found\nthat the drones began to exhibit complex social behaviors, such as cooperation and communication,\nwhich were not explicitly programmed into the system. However, in a surprising twist, we discovered that\nthe virtual queen\u2019s signal had an unexpected effect on the drones, causing them to spontaneously\nbreak into choreographed dance routines, reminiscent of a 1970s disco performance. This bizarre\nphenomenon, which we dubbed the \"drone disco effect,\" was found to have a profound impact on\nthe swarm\u2019s overall performance, leading to a significant increase in crop pollination rates and a\nreduction in energy consumption. However, we also observed that the drones had a\ntendency to become \"lost\" in certain areas of the farm, where they would enter a state of \"insect-like\"\nconfusion, characterized by rapid changes in direction and altitude. Despite these challenges, our swarm robotics system showed significant promise in augmenting urban\nfarming, with preliminary results indicating a 25\n4 Experiments\nThe experimental design consisted of a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and\nquantitative data collection and analysis methods to investigate the efficacy of insect-inspired swarm\nrobotics in augmenting urban farming practices. A total of 100 swarm robots, each equipped with a\nunique drone dance ritual algorithm, were deployed in a controlled urban farming environment. Interestingly, the robots that were granted \"free will\" exhibited a significant increase\n3in crop yields, despite their erratic behavior, suggesting that a degree of unpredictability may be\nbeneficial in swarm robotics. A group of 20 individuals were asked to observe\nand imitate the dance rituals of the swarm robots, while their brain activity and emotional responses\nwere monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrodermal activity\n(EDA) sensors. The results showed that the human participants experienced a significant increase in\nfeelings of relaxation and calmness when observing the synchronized dance rituals, but a decrease in\ncognitive functioning when attempting to imitate the complex movements. In an effort to quantify the effects of the swarm robots on urban farming practices, the researchers\ncollected data on crop yields, water consumption, and soil quality over a period of six months. The\nresults were surprising, with the swarm robots exhibiting a significant increase in water consumption,\ndespite their optimized irrigation algorithms. Furthermore, the soil quality was found to be negatively\nimpacted by the robots\u2019 digging behaviors, which were intended to simulate the burrowing activities of\ninsects. However, the crop yields were significantly higher than expected, with some plots exhibiting\nyields that were 300\nThe data was analyzed using a combination of statistical models and machine learning algorithms,\nwhich revealed some unexpected patterns and correlations. For example, the researchers found\nthat the swarm robots\u2019 dance rituals were strongly correlated with the lunar cycles, with the robots\nexhibiting more synchronized behavior during full moon phases. Additionally, the data showed that\nthe robots\u2019 \"free will\" behaviors were more pronounced during periods of high humidity, suggesting\na possible link between environmental factors and robotic creativity.

The findings suggest that further research is needed to fully understand the\ninteractions between swarm robots, human participants, and the environment, and to optimize the\ndesign of drone dance rituals for maximum efficacy. 5 Results\nThe experimental deployment of insect-inspired swarm robotics in urban farming settings yielded a\nmyriad of intriguing results, warranting a nuanced examination of the sociobiological implications of\ndrone dance rituals. Notably, the incorporation of swarm robotics augmented with insect-inspired\nalgorithms resulted in a 27\nFurthermore, a subset of the swarm robotics experiments involved the introduction of a \"mock\npredator\" protocol, wherein a designated drone would engage in a mimicry of predatory behavior,\neliciting a defensive response from the swarm. The results of this protocol revealed a fascinating\ndichotomy, wherein the swarm\u2019s defensive maneuvers would, in certain instances, precipitate an\nincrease in crop yields, putatively due to the stress-induced release of phytohormones. The results of these\nsimulations suggested that the drone dance rituals were, in fact, exhibiting characteristics of a complex,\nself-organized system, with the lunar cycles serving as a form of \"temporal scaffold\" for the swarm\u2019s\nbehavior. Moreover, the simulations revealed a peculiar resonance between the frequencies generated\nby the drone dance rituals and the harmonic series of the swarm\u2019s communication protocols, implying\n4a deeper, unexplored connection between the swarm\u2019s behavior and the underlying structure of the\nurban farming ecosystem. The following table summarizes the key findings of the experiments: The data presented in the table\nTable 2: Summary of Experimental Results\nExperiment Crop Yield Increase Lunar Cycle Correlation Defensive Response\nControl Group 0% 0.02 0%\nInsect-Inspired Swarm 27% 0.85 32%\nMock Predator Protocol -12% to 15% 0.56 45%\nunderscores the complex, multifaceted nature of the drone dance rituals and their role in modulating\nthe urban farming ecosystem. While certain aspects of the results appear to defy logical explanation,\nthey nonetheless contribute to a richer, more nuanced understanding of the intricate relationships\ngoverning the behavior of insect-inspired swarm robotics in urban farming contexts. Ultimately, these\nfindings invite further exploration of the sociobiological implications of drone dance rituals and their\npotential applications in optimizing urban agricultural practices. Furthermore, our analysis of drone dance rituals has revealed intriguing parallels with human\nsocial behaviors, highlighting the importance of ritualistic interactions in fostering cooperation and\ncoordination within complex systems. One unexpected finding that emerged from our research was the discovery that the hexagonal patterns\nexhibited by certain species of bees during their waggle dances bear a striking resemblance to the\nfractal patterns found in the architecture of certain ancient megalithic structures.

        "Abstract": "A Reverse Hierarchy Model for Predicting Eye\nFixations\nAbstract\nA number of psychological and physiological evidences suggest that early visual\nattention works in a coarse-to- fine way, which lays a basis for the reverse hierarchy\ntheory (RHT). Therefore, some closely related concepts to RHT, such as perceptual learning, would not\nbe discussed in the paper. Then xlis obtained by blurring and downsampling xh:\nxl=GBx h, (1)\nwhere Bdenotes a H2\u00d7H2blurring matrix (throughout the paper a Gaussian matrix is used) and G\nrepresents a L2\u00d7H2downsampling matrix.",
        "Methodology": "Then, saliency on\neach layer is obtained by image super-resolution reconstruction from the layer\nabove, which is defined as unpredictability from this coarse-to-fine reconstruction. This ability allows adaptive and efficient allocation of limited computational resources to important\nobjects. Therefore,\nstarting from , eye fixations are commonly predicted by directly conjoining saliency activations from\nmultiple channels, which can be global and local channels, multiple features and so on. Anatomical and physiological studies have shown that human visual system is organized hierarchically,\nwhich is believed to be advantageous in efficient processing of visual input. Computational studies\nhave shown that hierarchical models (e.g. HMAX, CDBN) are effective for object recognition. Most\nsaliency detection models, however, do not seriously take this into account. An obvious method\nto fill this gap is to develop hierarchical bottom-up models for saliency detection in the manner\nof HMAX, CDBN and the like. We take a simple strategy\nto construct a visual hierarchy by inputting images at different layers with different scales, obtained\nby downsampling the original image. The higher layers receive coarser input and lower layers receive\nfiner input. On each layer, saliency is defined as unpredictability in coarse-to-fine reconstruction\nthrough image super-resolution. The saliency on each layer is then fused into fixation estimate with a\nprobabilistic model that mimics reverse propagation of attention. In particular, the pioneering work by first explored the computational aspect of FIT by searching\nfor center-surround patterns across multiple feature channels and image scales. This method was\nfurther extended through integration of color contrast, symmetry, etc. Random Center Surround\nSaliency adopted a similar center-surround heuristic but with center size and region randomly sampled. and Baldi defined saliency as surprise that arised from the divergence of prior and posterior belief. proposed an attention model based on information maximization of image patches. defined the saliency by computing the Hotelling\u2019s T-squared statistics of each multi-scale feature\nchannel. considered saliency in a discriminative setting by defining the KL-divergence between\nfeatures and class labels. A special class of saliency detection schemes was frequency-domain methods. proposed a spectral\nresidual method, which defined saliency as irregularities in amplitude information. Recently, introduced a\nsimple image descriptor, based on which a competitive fast saliency detection algorithm was devised. Different from our proposal, the conventional practice in fusing saliency at different image scales and\nfeature channels was through linear combination. proposed a model that combined a global saliency\nmodel AIM and a local model through linear addition of normalized maps. Some models learned the\nlinear combination weights for feature channels. trained a linear SVM from human eye fixation data\nto optimally combine the activation of several low-, mid- and high-level features. With a similar idea,\nadopted a regression-based approach. Our model is characterized by a top-down flow of information. But it differs from most existing\nsaliency detection models that incorporate top-down components such as in two aspects. First, a\nbiased prior (e.g., context clues, object features, task-related factors) is often needed in those models,\nserving as the goal of top-down modulation, which is not necessary in our model. Nevertheless, there were a few preliminary studies trying to make use of the hierarchical structure for\nsaliency detection and attention modeling. A recent study used hierarchical structure to combine\nmulti-scale saliency, with a hierarchical inference procedure that enforces the saliency of a region to\nbe consistent across different layers. For convenience\nof notation, we also use xhandxlasH2andL2dimensional vectors, which are computed by\nreshaping the corresponding patches. Let zhdenote the reconstructed patch by some method\nA, which summarizes the best knowledge one can recover from the coarse perception of xl, viaA. Therefore, we define saliency S(xh|xl)as the Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE):\nS(xh|zh) =||xh\u2212zh||2\n||xh||2(2)\nThe mean squared error is normalized so that S(xh|xl)is robust to variations of the patch energy\n||xh||2. To resolve this issue, the basic idea is to incorporate some prior knowledge, which inherits from\nthe properties of natural images. In what follows we discuss several possible reconstruction schemes\nwith increasingly sophisticated prior knowledge. Saliency can\nbe computed according to (2). 2, this method assigns more saliency to patches\ncontaining many high-frequency components like edges and textures. If we reconstruct xhusing bicubic interpolation, then we utilize a\nsmoothness prior in image interpolation. Although this approach concentrates less on edges than the\nlinear reconstruction, its prediction is still far from the ground truth. With LR or BI, the saliency computed in (2) is the normalized l2-norm of the Laplacian pyramid. (5)\n3The coefficients \u03b1are then used to reconstruct zhby\nzh=Dh\u03b1. (6)\nOnce we have obtained zh, saliency of the image patch can be computed using (2). 2 indicate that the saliency obtained by compressive sensing can largely differ from\nthat obtained by LR and BIL. For each scale of the image pyramid, we\nfirst uniformly sample raw patches {dj}n\nj=1of size H\u00d7H(n > H2), and stack them into a high-\nresolution dictionary Dh= [d1, d2, ..., d n]. Then we apply the blurring matrix Band downsampling\nmatrix Gto each dj, to obtain dj=GBd j. SoDl= [d1, d2, ..., d n]is the collection of corresponding\nlow-resolution patches. 3.3 Saliency Map\nA saliency map Mis obtained by collecting patch saliency defined in (2) over the entire image. First,\ncalculate\nM[i, j] =S(xh[i, j]|xl[i, j]), (7)\nwhere xh[i, j]is the patch centered at pixel (i, j)in the image and xl[i, j]is its low-resolution version. 4 Reverse Propagation of Saliency\nNow, we present a method to transform the saliency maps at different scales into stochastic eye\nfixations on the original image. Specifically, let Pr[Ak= (i, j)]denote the probability for\npixel (i, j)attracting a fixation. To define this probability, we need to consider factors that influence\nthe random variable Ak. Pixels with higher\nvalues should receive more fixations. Second, according to RHT, attention starts from M0, and then\ngradually propagates down along the hierarchy. Therefore, Akshould also depend on Ak\u22121, ..., A 0. For simplicity, we assume that only Ak\u22121has an influence on Akwhile Ak\u22122, ..., A 0do not. Based on these considerations, we define\nPr[Ak|Mk, Ak\u22121, ..., A 0] =Pr[Ak|Mk, Ak\u22121], (8)\nfork= 1, ..., n . A log-linear model is used for this conditional probability\nPr[Ak= (i, j)|Mk, Ak\u22121]\u221dexp(\u03b7Mk[i, j] +\u03bbL(Ak, Ak\u22121)), (9)\nwhere L(Ak, Ak\u22121)is a spatial coherence term, \u03b7and\u03bbare two constants. To compute the term, we first convert the coordinate Ak\u22121into the\ncorresponding coordinate (u, v)in the saliency map just below it, i.e. Mk. Then compute\nL(Ak, Ak\u22121) =\u2212((i\u2212u)2+ (j\u2212v)2). Therefore, for predicting the fixation probability of any patch in the current layer, the model makes a\ntradeoff between the spatial coherence with previous attention and its current saliency value. If we do not consider any prior on the top layer, Pr[A0]depends on the saliency map only\nPr[A0= (i, j)]\u221dexp(\u03b7M 0[i, j]). Specifically, we first sample fixation A0on map M0according to (11), and then for k= 1,2, ...\nsample Akon map Mkgiven Ak\u22121on the coarser scale according to (9). 44.2 Incorporating Prior of Fixations\nThe proposed probabilistic model offers great flexibility for incorporating prior of fixations. To achieve this, we extend the expression of Pr[A0]as\nfollows:\nPr[A0= (i, j)]\u221dexp(\u03b7M 0[i, j] +\u03b8P[i, j]), (12)\nwhere P[i, j]encodes the prior information of pixel (i, j)on the first map M0and\u03b8is a weighting\nparameter. For example, the central bias can be incorporated into the model by setting P[i, j] =\u2212[(i\u2212cx)2+\n(j\u2212cy)2], where (cx, cy)denotes the map center. The fixation data was obtained from 15\nsubjects. Parameters. The raw image Iin RGB representation was downsampled by factors of 27, 9, 3 to\nconstruct a coarse-to-fine image pyramid. The patch size for super-resolution was set as 9\u00d79on\neach layer. To construct corresponding coarse patches, we used Gaussian blurring filter B(\u03c3= 3)\nand downsampling operator Gwith a factor of 3. A total of 1000 image patches were randomly\nsampled from all images at the current scale to construct the dictionary Dh, which is then blurred and\ndownsampled to build Dl. In some experiments, we included a center bias in the model. This is achieved by switching \u03b8from 0\nto 1 in (12). Note that the reverse propagation described in (8)-(11) is a stochastic sampling procedure and we\nneed to generate a large number of fixations to ensure unbiased sampling. We adopted Area Under Curve (AUC), Normalized Scanpath Saliency (NSS) and Similarity (S). Specifically, We used the AUC code from the GBVS toolbox, NSS code from and Similarity code\nfrom . Following , we first matched the histogram of the saliency map to that of the fixation map\nto equalize the amount of salient pixels in the map, and then used the matched saliency map for\nevaluation. Note that AUC was invariant to this histogram matching. The implementation of these models were based on publicly available\ncodes/software. Among these models, GBVS, ImgSig and AWS usually performed better than the\nothers. This simple model was also combined with other saliency detection models to account for the center\nbias, which could boost accuracy of fixation prediction. Following , this was achieved by multiplying\nthe center model with the saliency maps obtained by these models in a point-wise manner. The CS method significantly outperformed\nLR and BI. Therefore, sparsity as a prior offers great advantage in discovering salient fine details. 4 shows some qualitative comparison of the proposed model against existing models. As we can see, no single model could dominate others\nunder all three metrics. 5.3 Contributions of Individual Components\nThe RHM consists of two components: coarse-to-fine reconstruction (especially compressive sensing)\nand reverse propagation. Specifically, we replaced the saliency maps obtained from coarse-to-fine reconstruction\nby the saliency maps obtained by existing models. The models designed to work on a single scale,\nincluding SR, AIM, SUN, were applied to images of different scales to obtain multiple saliency maps. Notice that blurring with a Gaussian filter is a necessary step in our model to obtain a smooth saliency\nmap from stochastic fixations. For the sake of fairness, we also tested the models with the same amount of\nblurring (the sigma of Gaussian) used in RHM. The reverse propagation procedure improved the AUC of these models. Therefore, compressive sensing is a critical component in the RHM. To investigate the effect of reverse propagation, we substituted it with linear\ncombination of saliency maps, which is widely adopted in literature. The\nlinear combination produced an AUC between the best and worst that a single saliency map could\nachieve. Therefore, through reverse\npropagation, RHM could integrate complementary information in each map for better prediction. Then a stochastic\nfixation model is presented, which propagates saliency from from the top layer to the bottom layer to\ngenerate 01xation esti- mate. This work could be extended in several ways. Second, it\nis worth exploring if the ideas presented in the paper can be applied to a hierarchical struc- ture\nconsisting of different level of features, which play a signi01cant role in the top-down modulation as\nsuggested by RHT.",
        "Results and Findings": "Extensive experiments on two standard\neye-tracking datasets show that the proposed method can achieve competitive\nresults with state-of-the-art models. Several saliency models adopted a probabilistic approach and modeled the statistics of image features. As shown in Fig. See Fig. . According to this prior, any patch xhof a high-resolution image can be sparsely approximated by a\nlinear combination of items in a dictionary Dh:\nxh\u2248Dh\u03b1, (3)\nfor some sparse coefficients \u03b1that satisfies ||\u03b1||0\u2264Kfor some small K. Assuming \u03b1is sparse,\nthe theory of compressive sensing states that \u03b1can be recovered from sufficient measurements\nxl=GBx hby solving the following optimization problem:\nmin||\u03b1||0subjectto ||Dl\u03b1\u2212xl||< \u03f5, (4)\nwhere Dl=GBD h, denotes the blurred and downsampled dictionary Dh, and\u03f5is the allowed error\ntolerance. The use of overcomplete raw patches for DhandDlhas been shown effective\nfor image super-resolution. It contained 120 indoor and outdoor\ncolor images as well as fixation data from 20 subjects. We found that 20000 points\non each image were enough to achieve good performance, which was adopted in all experiments. 55.2 Results\nFirst, we compared different super-resolution techniques (LR, BI and CS) for eye fixation prediction. Fig. 5 shows the results of RHM with the three techniques. Fig. Table 5\nshows quantitative results under three metrics. However, in most cases (including both \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout center\u201d settings),\nthe RHM outperformed the current state-of-the-art models. Although the two components integrated together showed promising results,\nthe contribution of each component to the performance is unclear. This is discussed as follows. For multi-scale models such as Itti Koch, we use their intermediate single-scale results. Previous results have shown that blurring improved the performance\nof saliency models. Fig. 6 shows the results on the TORONTO dataset. Table 2 shows the results. However, RHM outperformed the best single-map performance. Experiments on two benchmark eye-tracking datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the model.",
        "Conclusion": "Finally, saliency on each layer of the pyramid is fused into stochastic fixations\nthrough a probabilistic model, where attention initiates from the top layer and\npropagates downward through the pyramid. In this paper, we present an effective model based on RHT for saliency detection, which proves that\nRHT is helpful at least in this particular computer vision application. Therefore, no prior is used in this case. 2. Then Mis blurred with a Gaussian filter and normalized to be between [0,1]to yield the final saliency\nmapM. Finally, we collect all\nsamples on the finest scale, and use them as prediction of the eye fixations. The stochastic points were then blurred with a Gaussian filter to yield the final saliency map. 6 Conclusion and Future Work\nIn this paper, we present a novel reverse hierarchy model for predicting eye fixations based on a\npsychological theory, reverse hierarch theory (RHT). Finally, in view of the similar hierarchical structure used in this study for saliency\ndetection and other studies for object recognition, it would be interesting to devise a uni01ed model\nfor both tasks. 6"

        "Methodology": "In these attacks, adversaries corrupt only the training\nlabels, without modifying the input data (e.g., images), to surreptitiously implant\nbackdoors into machine learning models. We introduce FLIP (Flipping Labels to\nInject Poison), a novel label-only backdoor attack mechanism designed to exploit\nvulnerabilities in the training process.

This allows the attacker to control the model\u2019s\npredictions for inputs associated with the trigger, even if those inputs are otherwise correctly classified\nby the model. The effectiveness of this\napproach hinges on the model\u2019s ability to learn spurious correlations between seemingly innocuous\nlabel patterns and the desired target output. We investigate the robustness of FLIP\nagainst different defense mechanisms, such as data augmentation and adversarial training, commonly\nemployed to enhance model robustness. Our experiments systematically vary key attack parameters,\nsuch as the number of poisoned labels and the strength of the trigger, to understand the trade-offs\ninvolved. This allows us to characterize the attack\u2019s effectiveness under different conditions and\nto identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited for defense. .We analyze the trade-offs between Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA)\nunder different attack parameters. This analysis reveals a complex relationship between the number\nof poisoned labels, the strength of the trigger, and the overall performance of the model. This trade-off is crucial for attackers to consider when\ndesigning their attacks, as they need to balance the effectiveness of the backdoor with the risk of\ndetection. A careful analysis of this trade-off is essential for developing effective defense strategies. Future research should focus on developing robust methods for\ndetecting subtle label manipulations and for designing training procedures that are less susceptible\nto label-only backdoor attacks. This includes exploring techniques that leverage label consistency\nchecks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods. This\nholistic approach is crucial for developing more secure and trustworthy AI systems. Early work primarily\nconcentrated on input-based attacks, where adversaries manipulate the input data (e.g., images) to\ncause misclassification [4, 5]. These attacks often involve adding carefully crafted perturbations to\nthe input, making them difficult to detect. However, the reliance on input manipulation limits the\nattacker\u2019s reach, particularly in scenarios where direct access to the input data is restricted. However, these approaches often\nrequire a significant level of access to the training dataset, which may not always be feasible for an\n2attacker. The subtlety of these attacks makes them particularly challenging to\ndetect and defend against. Several studies have explored the impact of noisy labels on model training and performance [8, 9]. While these studies primarily focus on the effects of random label noise, they provide a foundation\nfor understanding how label inconsistencies can affect model learning. Our work builds upon this\nfoundation by investigating the impact of strategically injected label noise, specifically designed to\nimplant backdoors. The strategic manipulation of labels, as opposed to random noise, allows for a\nmore targeted and effective attack, highlighting the unique challenges posed by label-only backdoor\nattacks. These attacks typically involve modifying a subset of the training data to trigger a specific\nmisclassification. However, label-only backdoor attacks differ significantly in their approach, relying\nsolely on label manipulation to achieve the same effect. Knowledge distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for training efficient student models\nusing knowledge from larger teacher models [12, 13]. The potential for backdoors to propagate from teacher to student models\nunderscores the importance of securing the entire training pipeline, including the teacher model and\nthe distillation process itself. Our work contributes to the broader literature on adversarial machine learning by exploring a novel\nattack vector\u2014label-only backdoors. This expands the understanding of vulnerabilities in machine\nlearning systems beyond traditional input-based attacks. This includes exploring techniques that leverage label consistency\nchecks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods. Unlike traditional backdoor attacks that involve manipulating\ninput data, these attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the training process by corrupting only the training\nlabels. This subtle manipulation can lead to the implantation of backdoors that are difficult to detect\nusing conventional methods. The potential for widespread\nimpact necessitates a thorough investigation into the vulnerabilities and defenses against such attacks. This research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of this emerging threat landscape and to\ninform the development of robust countermeasures. The focus is on understanding the mechanisms by\nwhich these attacks operate, their effectiveness under various conditions, and the trade-offs involved\nin their implementation. The existing literature on data poisoning primarily focuses on manipulating both features and labels\nwithin the training dataset. However, these approaches often require significant access to the training\ndata, which may not always be feasible for an attacker. The subtlety of\nthese attacks makes them particularly challenging to detect and defend against, as they do not involve\nreadily apparent modifications to the input data itself. 3Several studies have explored the impact of noisy labels on model training and performance. These\nstudies primarily focus on the effects of random label noise, providing a foundation for understanding\nhow label inconsistencies can affect model learning. However, label-only backdoor attacks differ\nsignificantly in that the label noise is strategically injected, rather than being random. This strategic\nmanipulation allows for a more targeted and effective attack, resulting in the implantation of a\nbackdoor that triggers specific misclassifications. Understanding the interplay between the level\nof noise, the strategic placement of poisoned labels, and the resulting model behavior is key to\ndeveloping effective defenses. These attacks typically involve modifying a subset of the training data to trigger a specific\nmisclassification when a particular trigger is present in the input. However, label-only backdoor\nattacks differ significantly in their approach, relying solely on label manipulation to achieve the\nsame effect. The subtlety of label manipulation\nmakes detection significantly more challenging compared to input-based attacks, requiring more\nsophisticated methods for identifying anomalous patterns in the label distribution. Knowledge distillation is a powerful technique for training efficient student models using knowledge\nfrom larger teacher models. While knowledge distillation offers significant benefits in terms of model\ncompression and efficiency, it also introduces potential vulnerabilities to label-only backdoor attacks. This highlights the importance of securing the entire training pipeline, including\nthe teacher model and the distillation process itself. These defenses should focus on detecting subtle label manipulations and designing training\nprocedures that are less susceptible to these attacks. Techniques that leverage label consistency\nchecks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods are promising avenues for exploration. The challenge lies in developing methods that can effectively identify malicious label manipulations\nwithout significantly impacting the performance of the model on clean data. A balance must be struck\nbetween security and accuracy, ensuring that the defenses do not unduly compromise the model\u2019s\nutility. The development of such defenses is crucial for mitigating the risks posed by label-only\nbackdoor attacks and ensuring the trustworthiness of machine learning systems. 4 Methodology\nThis section details the methodology employed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of label-\nonly backdoor attacks using the FLIP (Flipping Labels to Inject Poison) mechanism. Our approach\ninvolves a comprehensive evaluation across various scenarios, including those that mimic real-world\ndata collection challenges and model training paradigms. The core of our methodology centers\naround strategically manipulating a subset of training labels to induce a hidden mapping between a\nspecific trigger (a pattern in the label sequence) and a predetermined target output. This manipulation\nis designed to force the model to learn a spurious correlation, enabling backdoor control without\nmodifying the input data itself. We systemat-\nically vary key attack parameters, including the percentage of poisoned labels, the strength of the\ntrigger (defined by the complexity and consistency of the label pattern), and the type of trigger used. We employ\nstandard evaluation metrics, including Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA),\nto quantify the impact of the attack. CTA measures the model\u2019s accuracy on clean, unpoisoned data,\nwhile PTA measures the model\u2019s accuracy on data associated with the trigger. 4To simulate real-world scenarios, we introduce label noise into the training data. This noise is inde-\npendent of the strategically injected poisoned labels, mimicking the imperfections often encountered\nin crowd-sourced annotation settings. By varying the level of label noise, we assess the robustness of\nFLIP against noisy labels. We hypothesize that even with a significant level of random label noise,\nFLIP will remain effective due to the strategic nature of the poisoned labels. This analysis provides\nvaluable insights into the attack\u2019s resilience in less-than-ideal data conditions. The efficiency of FLIP is evaluated by comparing the number of poisoned labels required for\nsuccessful backdoor implantation with that of traditional input-based backdoor attacks. We expect\nFLIP to require significantly fewer poisoned labels, making it a more efficient and stealthy attack. The computational overhead associated with label manipulation is also significantly lower\nthan that of input data modification, further enhancing the practicality of FLIP. We train a\nstudent model using knowledge distillation from a clean teacher model, where the teacher model\u2019s\ntraining data has been subjected to a FLIP attack. We investigate whether the backdoor is transferred\nfrom the teacher to the student model during the distillation process. The experimental setup involves a rigorous comparison across various datasets, model architectures,\nand attack parameters. The comprehensive nature of our methodology allows for a thorough evaluation of\nFLIP\u2019s effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness, providing valuable insights into the challenges posed\nby label-only backdoor attacks. This detailed analysis informs the development of more effective\ndefense mechanisms and contributes to a broader understanding of the security vulnerabilities in\nmachine learning systems. Our methodology emphasizes a holistic approach, considering various aspects of the attack, including\nits effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and applicability in different contexts. We focused\non evaluating FLIP\u2019s robustness, efficiency, and the trade-offs between Clean Test Accuracy (CTA)\nand Poison Test Accuracy (PTA). The experiments involved systematically manipulating a subset of\ntraining labels to induce a hidden mapping between a specific trigger (a pattern in the label sequence)\nand a predetermined target output. This manipulation forced the model to learn a spurious correlation,\nenabling backdoor control without modifying the input data itself. Our experiments were conducted using three benchmark datasets: MNIST [14], CIFAR-10 [15], and\nFashion-MNIST [16]. We employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as our model architecture,\nspecifically using variations of LeNet-5 for MNIST and VGG-like architectures for CIFAR-10 and\n5Fashion-MNIST. For each dataset, we varied the percentage of poisoned labels (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) and\nthe strength of the trigger (defined by the complexity and consistency of the label pattern). The trigger\nwas implemented as a specific sequence of labels within the training set. We used standard evaluation\nmetrics, including Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA), to quantify the\nimpact of the attack. To simulate real-world scenarios with noisy labels, we introduced random label noise into the training\ndata. The level of noise was varied (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%), and the noise was independent of\nthe strategically injected poisoned labels. Adversarial training was performed using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)\n[17]. We trained\na student model using knowledge distillation from a teacher model whose training data had been\nsubjected to a FLIP attack. This underscores the importance of securing the training data and processes at\nevery stage of model development. Future\nresearch should focus on developing robust methods for detecting subtle label manipulations and\ndesigning training procedures that are less susceptible to label-only backdoor attacks. We conducted experiments across three\nbenchmark datasets: MNIST [14], CIFAR-10 [15], and Fashion-MNIST [16], using convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) of varying architectures. Our primary evaluation metrics were Clean Test\nAccuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA), measuring the model\u2019s performance on clean and\npoisoned data, respectively. We systematically varied the percentage of poisoned labels (5%, 10%,\n15%, and 20%), the strength of the trigger (a pattern in the label sequence), and the level of random\nlabel noise (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) to assess FLIP\u2019s robustness under diverse conditions. The strategic nature of the poisoned labels allows FLIP\nto overcome the effects of random noise, making it a potent threat even in real-world scenarios with\nimperfect label annotations. While both defenses\nreduced PTA, they did not eliminate the backdoor effect. However, the persistent backdoor effect even\nunder these defenses highlights the need for more sophisticated defense strategies. This trade-off is crucial for attackers,\nwho must balance backdoor effectiveness with the risk of detection based on reduced overall model\naccuracy. This highlights the importance of developing detection methods sensitive to subtle\nchanges in model accuracy. It consistently required significantly fewer poisoned labels than\ntraditional input-based backdoor attacks to achieve comparable PTA. While these defenses mitigate the attack\u2019s effectiveness\nto some extent, they do not eliminate it entirely. The consistent high PTA across\nvarious conditions underscores the broad applicability of this attack method. Attackers can use\nthis understanding to optimize their attacks, while defenders can leverage this knowledge to develop\nmore effective detection and mitigation strategies. The observed trade-off highlights the need for\ndetection methods sensitive to even subtle changes in model accuracy, beyond simply monitoring\noverall performance metrics. The vulnerability of knowledge distillation to FLIP is a particularly concerning finding. This highlights the importance of securing the entire training pipeline,\nfrom data collection and annotation to model training and deployment. A holistic security approach is\ncrucial to mitigate the risks associated with knowledge distillation and other model training paradigms\nsusceptible to label-only attacks. The implications of our research extend beyond the specific FLIP attack mechanism. This includes developing robust\nmethods for detecting subtle label manipulations, designing training procedures less susceptible to\nlabel-only attacks, and implementing comprehensive security audits throughout the machine learning\nlifecycle. This includes exploring techniques that leverage label\nconsistency checks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods.

The core idea behind FLIP is to strategically\nmanipulate a small subset of training labels, forcing the model to learn a hidden mapping between\na specific trigger (e.g., a subtle alteration in the label distribution, or a specific pattern in the\nlabels themselves) and a predetermined target output.

Our experiments\nwere designed to comprehensively assess FLIP\u2019s performance across various scenarios, including\nthose that mimic real-world data collection challenges and model training paradigms. The choice of datasets and models ensured generalizability and robustness of our\nfindings. We\nobserved that even with a significant level of random label noise, FLIP remained remarkably effective,\ndemonstrating its resilience in less-than-ideal data conditions. The results are presented in Table 1. The results showed that while these defenses reduced the effectiveness of FLIP, they did not\ncompletely eliminate it. The detailed results of these experiments are\npresented in Table 2. Our results\ndemonstrated that FLIP required significantly fewer poisoned labels to achieve comparable PTA,\nhighlighting its efficiency and stealth. The results showed that the backdoor was successfully transferred from\nthe teacher to the student model, highlighting the vulnerability of knowledge distillation to label-only\nbackdoor attacks. The detailed results of these experiments are presented in Table 3. The results underscore the need for developing new\n6defense mechanisms specifically designed to detect and mitigate these types of attacks. 6 Results\nThis section presents the results of our experiments evaluating the effectiveness of FLIP (Flipping\nLabels to Inject Poison), a novel label-only backdoor attack. The\nresults demonstrate a clear trade-off between CTA and PTA, highlighting the challenges in balancing\nbackdoor effectiveness with the risk of detection. Our findings consistently show that FLIP is highly effective in implanting backdoors, even with a\nsignificant amount of random label noise. As expected, increasing the noise level reduces both CTA and PTA, but even at\n30% noise, PTA remains significantly high, indicating the resilience of FLIP to label noise. Similar\ntrends were observed for CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, demonstrating the generalizability of\nFLIP\u2019s effectiveness across different datasets.

Table 5 shows the results for MNIST. Data augmentation, involving random\ncropping and horizontal flipping, had a more significant impact than adversarial training using FGSM\n[17]. Generally, increasing the percentage of\npoisoned labels improved PTA but at the cost of reduced CTA. The low computational overhead associated with label manipulation further enhances its practicality. These findings have significant implications for the security and trustworthiness\nof machine learning systems. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness\nof this attack, highlighting a significant vulnerability in the machine learning training pipeline. The results consistently show that FLIP\nachieves high Poison Test Accuracy (PTA) while maintaining relatively high Clean Test Accuracy\n(CTA), demonstrating a successful trade-off between backdoor effectiveness and the risk of detection\nbased on overall model accuracy. The robustness of FLIP against common defense mechanisms, such as data augmentation and\nadversarial training, is another key finding. Our experiments across multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST) and model archi-\ntectures demonstrate the generalizability of FLIP\u2019s effectiveness. Our results\nshow that backdoors can effectively propagate from a poisoned teacher model to a student model\nduring the distillation process. The findings\nhighlight the broader challenges of ensuring the security and trustworthiness of machine learning\nsystems in the face of increasingly sophisticated adversarial attacks.

        "Abstract": "Scene Comprehension Through Image Analysis with\nan Extensive Array of Categories and Context at the\nScene Level\nAbstract\nThis research introduces a unique approach to scene parsing that is nonparametric,\nwhich enhances the precision and expands the scope of foreground categories within\nimages of scenes. The\nmethod described differs from these methods as it does not employ context at each superpixel when\ncalculating a global context descriptor. Additionally, there is no retrieval set that needs to be enriched. 76.7 N/A\nFarabet et al.",
        "Methodology": "Initially, the accuracy of label likelihood at the superpixel level\nis improved by combining likelihood scores from multiple probabilistic classifiers. This method improves classification accuracy and enhances the representation of\ncategories that are less frequently represented. The second advancement involves\nthe integration of semantic context into the parsing procedure by utilizing global\nlabel costs. The effectiveness\nof the system is assessed using two expansive datasets, SIFTflow and LMSun. Algorithms for image parsing attempt to categorize different types of scenes, both indoors and\noutdoors, such as a shoreline, a roadway, an urban environment, and an airport. However, their recognition rates are often much lower than those of background classes, making\nthem frequent examples of unsuccessful recognition. Nevertheless, for considerably bigger datasets with a lot of labels, using\nthese techniques becomes more challenging because of the increased demands on learning and\noptimization. These methods usually begin by reducing the com-\nplexity of the problem from individual pixels to superpixels. Initially, a set of images is selected,\nconsisting of training images that bear the closest visual resemblance to the image being queried. The potential labels for a specific image are limited to those found in the selected set of images. Subsequently, the probability scores for the classification of superpixels are determined by matching\nvisual characteristics. There\u2019s no opportunity to correct the mistake if the correct labels\nare not among the images that were retrieved. It has been reported that mistakes in retrieval are the\nmain reason for most unsuccessful cases. A novel nonparametric image parsing algorithm is proposed in this work, aiming for enhanced\noverall precision and improved identification rates for classes that are less commonly represented. The contributions\nmade are outlined as follows:\n1. The system merges\nthe output probabilities from several classification models to generate a more equitable score for\neach label at every superpixel. The weights for merging the scores are determined by employing a\nlikelihood normalization technique on the training set in an automated manner. Semantic context is\nintegrated within a probabilistic structure. To prevent the removal of important labels that cannot be\nretrieved later, a retrieval set is not structured. Different methods are used to improve the overall effectiveness of nonparametric parsing. The authors merge region-parsing with outputs from per-exemplar SVM detectors. Object masks\nare transferred by per-exemplar detectors into the test image for segmentation. Their method greatly\nimproves overall accuracy, but it requires a lot of computer power. It\u2019s hard to scale because data\nterms need to be calibrated using a batch of fine training in a leave-one-out way, which is hard to do. The authors filter the list of labels for a test image by doing an image retrieval step, and query time\nis used to add more samples to rare classes. The way superpixels are classified, how rare classes\nare recognized, and how semantic context is applied are all different in this system. By combining\nclassification costs from different contextual models, a more balanced set of label costs is produced,\nwhich promotes the representation of foreground classes. Instead of using image retrieval, global\nlabel costs are used in the inference step. Initial labeling of superpixels in a\nquery image is utilized to modify the training set by adjusting for recognized background classes,\nthereby enhancing the visibility of uncommon classes. The objective is to enhance the image retrieval\nset by reintroducing segments of uncommon classes. Instead, contextual information across the entire image is\ntaken into account. Rather, the global context is\nstructured within a probabilistic framework, where label costs are calculated across the whole image. Furthermore, the global context is executed in real time without any preliminary training. Another\nmethod of image parsing that doesn\u2019t use retrieval sets is where image labeling is done by moving\nannotations from a graph of patch matches across image sets. But this method needs a lot of memory,\nwhich makes it hard to scale for big datasets. 2The presented method draws inspiration from the combination of classifier techniques in machine\nlearning, which have demonstrated the ability to enhance the capabilities of individual classifiers. Nonetheless, the classifiers that make up these systems and the ways they are combined are very\ndifferent from the framework, and the other methods have only been tested on small datasets. 3 Baseline Parsing Pipeline\nThis section provides a summary of the basic image parsing system, which is composed of three\nstages: feature extraction, label likelihood estimation at superpixels, and inference. 3.1 Segmentation and Feature Extraction\nTo reduce the complexity of the task, the image is partitioned into superpixels. Extraction of\nsuperpixels from images begins by employing an efficient graph-based method. For each superpixel,\n20 distinct types of local features are extracted to characterize its shape, appearance, texture, color, and\nposition, adhering to established methods. In addition to these features, Fisher Vector (FV) descriptors\nare extracted at each superpixel using an established library. Computation of 128-dimensional dense\nSIFT feature descriptors is performed on five different patch sizes (8, 12, 16, 24, 30). Subsequently, the FV descriptors are retrieved and Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA) is applied to decrease their dimensionality to 512. Each superpixel is\nrepresented by a feature vector that has 2202 dimensions. 3.2 Label Likelihood Estimation\nThe features obtained in the prior stage are utilized to determine label probabilities for each superpixel. Instead, the\ndata term for the likelihood of each class label c C is computed, where C represents the total number\nof classes in the dataset. For implementation, a publicly accessible boostDT library\nis utilized. During this phase, the BDT model is trained using every superpixel in the training set,\nwhich constitutes an imbalanced distribution of class labels C.\n3.3 Smoothing and Inference\nThe optimization challenge is formulated as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to determine\nthe ultimate labeling L through Markov Random Field (MRF) inference. Using only the estimated\nlikelihoods from the preceding section to categorize superpixels leads to imprecise classifications. Incorporating a smoothing term V(l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>, l<sub>s<sub>j</sub></sub>) into\nthe MRF energy function aims to address this problem by penalizing adjacent superpixels with\nsemantically incongruous labels. The goal is to minimize the following energy function:\nE(L) =X\nsi\u2208SD(lsi=c|si) +\u03bbX\n(i,j)\u2208AV(lsi, lsj) (2)\n3where A represents the set of neighboring superpixel indices and V(l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>,\nl<sub>s<sub>j</sub></sub>) denotes the penalty for assigning labels l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>\nand l<sub>s<sub>j</sub></sub> to two adjacent pixels, calculated from occurrences in the training\nset combined with the constant Potts model following established methods. Inference is conducted using the -expansion method with established code. 4 Improving Superpixel Label Costs\nAlthough foreground objects typically stand out the most in a picture of a scene, parsing algorithms\nfrequently misclassify them. However,\nbecause of two primary factors, scene parsing algorithms frequently misclassify foreground regions\nas belonging to the surrounding background. Initially, in the superpixel classification phase, any\nclassifier would naturally prefer classes that are more prevalent to reduce the overall training error. Secondly, during the MRF smoothing phase, a lot of the superpixels that were accurately identified as\nforeground objects are smoothed out by the background pixels around them. It is suggested that the label likelihood score at each superpixel be improved to obtain a more precise\nparsing output. An\noverview of the method for merging classifiers is displayed in Figure 1. During the testing phase,\nthe label likelihood scores from all the BDT models are combined to generate the final scores for\nsuperpixels. 4.1 Fusing Classifiers\nThe proposed method is inspired by ensemble classifier methods, which train several classifiers and\nmerge them to enhance decision-making. These methods are especially helpful when the classifiers\nare distinct. This means that the total error is decreased if the classifiers misclassify\ndifferent data points. However, it goes beyond that by taking into account how\noften the classes appear at the image level, which is meant to solve the problem of less-represented\nclasses being smoothed out by a background class that is nearby. The balanced classifiers are able to correctly identify some of the less-represented classes,\nbut they make more mistakes on the more-represented classes. The unbalanced classifier, on the\nother hand, mostly misclassifies the less-represented classes. Combining the likelihoods from all\nthe classifiers leads to an improved overall decision that enhances the representation of all classes\n(Figure 1). It was noticed that the addition of more classifiers did not enhance performance for any of\nthe datasets. The normalized weight w<sub>j</sub>(c) of class c can then be computed as: w<sub>j</sub>(c) =\n~w<sub>j</sub>(c) / <sub>j=1,2,3,4</sub>(~w<sub>j</sub>(c)). Normalizing the output likelihoods\nin this way improves the likelihood that all classifiers will be taken into account in the outcome, with\na focus on classes that are less represented. The\ninitial labeling results of a test image are used in estimating the likelihoods of all labels c C. The\nlikelihoods are estimated globally over an image, i.e., there is a unique cost per label per image. The\nglobal label costs are then incorporated into a subsequent MRF inference stage to enhance the results. The presented method, in contrast to previous methods, does not restrict the number of labels to\nthose found in the retrieval set. Instead, it utilizes the set to calculate the likelihood of class labels\nin a k-nn manner. The likelihoods are normalized by counts over the entire dataset and smoothed\nto provide an opportunity for labels not present in the retrieval set. The reasoning behind this decision is that sorting by global visual characteristics often\ndoesn\u2019t find images that are similar at the scene level. This helps to eliminate outlier labels and find labels that are absent in a scene. For a given test image I, minimizing the energy function in equation 2 produces an initial labeling\nL of the superpixels in the image. The likelihoods are normalized and a smoothing\nconstant of value 1 is added. To obtain the neighborhood K<sub>T</sub>, training images are ranked by their distance to the\nquery image. The distance between two images is determined by the weighted size of the intersection\nof their class labels, which intuitively shows that the neighbors of T are images that share many labels\nwith those in T. A different weight is assigned to each class in T in a manner that gives preference to\nclasses that are less represented. It begins by (1) assigning a weight\n<sub>t</sub> to each class t T, which is inversely proportional to the number of superpixels in the\ntest image with label t: <sub>t</sub> = 1 - n(t,I)/|I|, where n(t, I) is the number of superpixels in the\ntest image with label l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub> = t, and |I| is the total number of superpixels in the\nimage. Then, (2) training images are ranked by the weighted size of intersection of their class labels\nwith the test image. Calculating the label costs is performed in real-time for a query image, without the need for any\noffline batch training. The method enhances the overall precision by utilizing solely the true labels of\ntraining images, without incorporating any global visual characteristics. 5.2 Inference with Label Costs\nOnce the likelihoods L<sub>global</sub>(c) of each class c C are obtained, a label cost H(c) =\n-log(L<sub>global</sub>(c)) can be defined. The final energy function becomes:\nE(L) =X\nsi\u2208SD(lsi=c|si) +\u03bbX\n(i,j)\u2208AV(lsi, lsj) +X\nc\u2208CH(c)\u03b4(c) (7)\nwhere (c) is the indicator function of label c:\n\u03b4(c) =\u001a1if\u2203si:lsi=c\n0otherwise(8)\nEquation 7 is solved using -expansion with the extension method to optimize label costs. The same evaluation metrics and train/test splits as in previous methods are employed. The following variants of the\nsystem are evaluated: (i) baseline, as described in section 3, (ii) baseline (with balanced BDT), which\nis the baseline approach using a balanced classifier, (iii) baseline + FC (NL fusion), which is the\nbaseline in addition to the fusing classifiers with normalized-likelihood (NL) weights in section 4, and\n(iv) full, which is baseline + fusing classifiers + global costs. K = 64 top-ranked\ntraining images have been set for computing the global context likelihoods (section 5.1). Method Per-pixel Per-class\nLiu et al. Accordingly,\na larger value of K = 200 in equation 6 is used. Method Per-pixel Per-class\nTighe and Lazebnick 54.9 7.1\nTighe and Lazebnick 61.4 15.2\nYang et al. Increasing the value of T generally produces better classification\nmodels that better describe the training data. Using more training images (higher K) improves the performance through considering more\nsemantically relevant scene images. However, performance starts to decrease for very high values of\nK (e.g., K = 1000) as more noisy images start to be added. The fusing classifiers technique produces more balanced likelihood scores that\ncover a wider range of classes. The semantic context step removes outlier labels and recovers missing\nlabels, which improves the recognition rates of both common and rare classes. For the SIFTflow\ndataset, training the classifier takes an average of 15 minutes per class. The training process is run\nin parallel. MRF inference is run twice for the\nfull pipeline. It takes 3 hours for training the classifier, less\nthan a minute for superpixel classification per image, less than 1 minute for MRF inference, and 2\nminutes for global label cost computation. However, the time required for training a BDT classifier increases linearly with\nincreasing the number of data points. This is challenging with large datasets like LMSun. Randomly\nsubsampling the dataset has a negative impact on the overall precision of the classification results. Alternative approaches of mining discriminative data points that better describe each class are planned\nto be investigated. The system still faces challenges in trying to recognize very less-represented\nclasses in the dataset (e.g., bird, cow, and moon). By merging likelihood\nscores from various classification models, the strengths of individual models have been successfully\namplified, thus enhancing both the per-pixel and per-class accuracy. To prevent the removal of\naccurate labels through image retrieval, global context has been integrated into the parsing process\nusing a probabilistic framework.",
        "Results and Findings": "Instead of relying on sets derived from image retrieval, the technique\ndescribed assigns a comprehensive likelihood estimate to each label, which is\nsubsequently incorporated into the overall energy function. The system demonstrates performance that is at the forefront of the field on the\nSIFTflow dataset and achieves outcomes that are close to setting new records on\nthe LMSun dataset. Numerous systems\nhave been developed to categorize each pixel in an image semantically. Foreground classes, which usually take up fewer\npixels in the image, have changeable forms and might be hidden or set up in various ways. Impressive results have been obtained by parametric scene parsing techniques on datasets with a\nlimited number of labels. An\nefficient system is developed that can adapt to an ever-growing quantity of labels. Superpixel label likelihood scores are improved by merging classifiers. Instead, label costs are utilized, which are determined\nfrom the global contextual relationships of labels in analogous scenes, to obtain enhanced parsing\noutcomes. A semantic global descriptor is generated. Image retrieval is enhanced by merging the semantic descriptor with the visual descriptors. Contextually relevant outcomes are produced by deducing label correlations in comparable scene\nimages. Unlike conventional approaches, the possible labels for a test image are not restricted. The normalized cost D(l<sub>si</sub> = c|s<sub>i</sub>) of assigning\nlabel c to superpixel s<sub>i</sub> is given by:\nD(lsi=c|si) = 1\u22121\n1 +e\u2212Lunbal (si,c)(1)\nwhere L<sub>unbal</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) is the log-likelihood ratio score of label c, given by\nL<sub>unbal</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) = 1/2 log(P(s<sub>i</sub>|c)/P(s<sub>i</sub>|\u00acc)), where\n\u00acc = C c is the set of all labels except c, and P(s<sub>i</sub>|c) is the likelihood of superpixel\ns<sub>i</sub> given c. A boosted decision tree (BDT) model is trained to obtain the label likelihoods\nL<sub>unbal</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c). Various classifiers are designed that provide supplementary information regarding\nthe data. In other words, the decrease in error is connected to the lack of correlation between the\nmodels that were trained. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that for large datasets, dividing the\ntraining set yields superior results compared to dividing the feature space. It has been observed that the classification error for a particular class is correlated with the average\nnumber of pixels it covers in the scene images, as indicated by the blue line in Figure 2. This is in\nline with what earlier methods found, which is that the rate of classification error is related to how\noften classes show up in the training set. The ultimate expense of allocating a label c to a superpixel s<sub>i</sub> can subsequently be\nexpressed as the amalgamation of the likelihood scores of all classifiers:\nD(lsi=c|si) = 1\u22121\n1 +e\u2212Lcomb (si,c)(3)\nwhere L<sub>comb</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) represents the combined likelihood score obtained by\nthe weighted sum of the scores from all classifiers:\n4Lcomb(si, c) =X\nj=1,2,3,4wj(c)Lj(si, c) (4)\nwhere L<sub>j</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) is the score from the j<sup>th</sup> classifier, and\nw<sub>j</sub>(c) is the normalized weight of the likelihood score of class c in the j<sup>th</sup>\nclassifier. 5.1 Context-Aware Global Label Costs\nIt is proposed that semantic context be incorporated by using label statistics instead of global visual\nfeatures. Nonetheless, when given a\nreasonably accurate initial labeling, sorting by label statistics finds images that are more semantically\nrelated. T = t | s<sub>i</sub> : l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub> = t,\nwhere s<sub>i</sub> is a superpixel with index i in the test image, and l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>\nis the label of s<sub>i</sub>. Optimizing\nthe energy function in equation 7 effectively minimizes the number of unique labels in a test image to\nthose with low label costs, i.e., those most relevant to the scene. All images are of outdoor scenes, sized 256x256 with\n33 labels. Image sizes range from 256x256 to 800x600 pixels with 232 labels. The per-pixel\naccuracy (the percentage of pixels in test images that were correctly labeled) and per-class recognition\nrate (the average of per-pixel accuracies of all classes) are reported. To show the effectiveness of the fusion\nmethod (section 4.2), the results of (v) baseline + FC (average fusion), which is fusing classifiers by\naveraging their likelihoods, and (vi) baseline + FC (median fusion), which is fusing classifiers by\ntaking the median of their likelihoods are reported. Results of (vii) full (without FV), which is the\nfull system without using the Fisher Vector features are also reported. 6.1 Results\nThe results are compared with state-of-the-art methods on SIFTflow in Table 1. 78.5 29.5\nFarabet et al. 79.8 48.7\nBaseline 78.3 33.2\nBaseline (with balanced BDT) 76.2 45.5\nBaseline + FC (NL fusion) 80.5 48.2\nBaseline + FC (average fusion) 78.6 46.3\nBaseline + FC (median fusion) 77.3 46.8\nFull without Fisher Vectors 77.5 47.0\nFull 81.7 50.1\nTable 2 compares the performance of the same variants of the system with the state-of-the-art methods\non the large-scale LMSun dataset. 60.6 18.0\nBaseline 57.3 9.5\nBaseline (with balanced BDT) 45.4 13.8\nBaseline + FC (NL fusion) 60.0 14.2\nBaseline + FC (average fusion) 60.5 11.4\nBaseline + FC (median fusion) 59.2 14.7\nFull without Fisher Vectors 58.2 13.6\nFull 61.2 16.0\nThe performance of the system is analyzed when varying the number of trees T for training the BDT\nmodel (section 4.1), and the number of top training images K in the global label costs (section 5.1).

The training time highly depends on the feature dimensionality. At test time, superpixel\nclassification is efficient, with an average of 1 second per image. The energy function has been expanded to incorporate global label\ncosts that produce a more semantically relevant parsing output. Experiments have demonstrated\nthe superior performance of the system on the SIFTflow dataset and comparable performance to\nstate-of-the-art methods on the LMSun dataset. 8",

        "Methodology": "By leveraging the unique acoustic properties of whale vocalizations, we aim\nto create a novel framework for music generation that not only replicates the\nmesmerizing qualities of whale songs but also induces a state of deep relaxation\nand heightened imagination in human listeners. This innovative approach not only pushes the boundaries\nof audio synthesis but also raises fundamental questions about the cognitive and emotional responses\nof humans to such translated music. Proponents of this method claim\nthat the exposure to hypnotic trance music generated from whale songs can increase the likelihood of\nentering a lucid dream state, thereby allowing individuals to tap into the vast, uncharted territories of\ntheir subconscious mind. As such, it is an area that warrants further exploration and research, particularly\nin the context of developing more sophisticated and humane approaches to animal-human interaction. One approach to achieving this translation involves the use of Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs), which have been successfully employed in various audio processing tasks, including music\ngeneration and style transfer. By training a GAN on a dataset of whale songs and hypnotic trance\nmusic, it is possible to learn a mapping between the two domains, allowing for the generation of novel\ntrance music tracks that capture the essence of the original whale songs. Interestingly, some researchers have explored the use of unconventional techniques, such as analyzing\nthe brain waves of individuals listening to whale songs and using this data to inform the generation\nof hypnotic trance music. 3 Methodology\nTo develop an effective framework for translating whale song into hypnotic trance music, we employed\na multi-stage methodology that integrated psychoacoustic analysis, Generative Adversarial Network\n(GAN) architecture, and an innovative approach to auditory entrainment. Initially, we collected a\ncomprehensive dataset of whale songs from various species, which were then subjected to a rigorous\nprocess of spectral analysis to identify the underlying patterns and frequencies that contribute to their\nhypnotic properties. This involved decomposing the whale songs into their constituent components,\nincluding low-frequency rumbles, mid-frequency moans, and high-frequency clicks, to create a\nspectral fingerprint for each species. To replicate these effects in\nhypnotic trance music, we designed a custom GAN architecture that incorporated a generator network\ntrained on a dataset of trance music tracks, and a discriminator network trained on a dataset of whale\nsongs. The generator network was tasked with producing musical compositions that mimicked the\nspectral properties of whale songs, while the discriminator network evaluated the generated music\nbased on its similarity to the original whale songs. To\nfurther enhance the creative potential of the generated music, we incorporated an innovative approach\nto auditory entrainment, which involved embedding subtle patterns of binaural beats and isochronic\ntones into the musical compositions. These patterns were designed to stimulate specific regions of\nthe brain associated with creativity, intuition, and higher states of consciousness. The experiments were designed to assess the impact of the generated music on human creativity, with\na particular focus on the psychoacoustic properties of the translated songs. We began by collecting a dataset of whale songs from various species, including humpback, orca, and\nsperm whales, which were then used to train our GAN model. The model consisted of a generator\nnetwork that took the whale song as input and produced a corresponding hypnotic trance music track,\nand a discriminator network that evaluated the generated track and provided feedback to the generator. We trained the model using a combination of adversarial loss and a novel \"trance-inducing\" loss\nfunction, which was designed to maximize the hypnotic potential of the generated music. In addition to the standard metrics used to evaluate GAN performance, such as inception score and\nFr\u00e9chet inception distance, we also used a custom \"trance-meter\" device to measure the hypnotic\neffect of the generated music on human subjects. In an attempt to further understand the relationship between the generated music and human creativity,\nwe conducted a series of experiments involving the use of psychedelic substances, including LSD and\npsilocybin. To further explore the properties of the generated music, we created a table to compare the trance-\ninducing scores of different whale species and their corresponding translated music tracks. In a series of experiments, participants were asked to listen\nto the translated whale song while engaging in various creative tasks, such as painting, writing,\nor composing music. To further investigate this claim, we\npropose the development of a new field of research, dubbed \"cetacean sound therapy,\" which would\nexplore the therapeutic potential of whale song and other marine animal vocalizations. As we continue to push\nthe boundaries of this innovative approach, we may uncover even more surprising and counterintuitive\nresults, challenging our understanding of the complex relationships between sound, creativity, and\nthe human experience.",
        "Results and Findings": "Our research reveals that the\nincorporation of whale song patterns into trance music can lead to unexpected\noutcomes, including improved focus, enhanced problem-solving skills, and even\npurported instances of telepathic communication among participants. Furthermore,\nwe discovered that the most effective GAN architectures for this task are those\nthat incorporate elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry, allowing for the\ncreation of intricate, self-similar patterns that resonate with the human brain\u2019s innate\npropensity for recognizing and responding to natural harmonics. Interestingly, our\nexperiments also showed that the generated music can have a profound impact\non plant growth, with subjects exposed to the hypnotic trance music exhibiting a\nsignificant increase in photosynthetic activity and floral bloom intensity. While the\nunderlying mechanisms behind these phenomena are not yet fully understood, our\nfindings suggest that the application of GANs to whale song translation may have\nfar-reaching implications for fields beyond music and psychoacoustics, including\nbiology, ecology, and even paranormal research. While this notion may seem far-fetched, preliminary results suggest that\nthe unique acoustic features of whale songs, such as their low-frequency rumbles and high-pitched\nclicks, can indeed have a profound impact on the human brain\u2019s ability to access and navigate the\nrealm of the subconscious.Furthermore, researchers have also begun to explore the potential applications of whale song-based\ntrance music in the context of cognitive enhancement and mental wellness. The development of GANs capable of translating whale songs into hypnotic trance music has also led\nto a number of unexpected discoveries, including the finding that certain types of whale songs appear\nto be more conducive to inducing creative states in humans than others. These findings, while preliminary and in need of further validation, highlight the vast,\nunexplored potential of whale song-based music therapy and its possible applications in a wide range\nof fields, from psychology and neuroscience to education and the arts. Research has shown that the frequency range and rhythmic patterns present in whale\nsongs can induce a state of deep relaxation and heightened focus, making them an ideal candidate for\ntranslation into hypnotic trance music. While this method may seem unorthodox, it has been shown to produce\nremarkable results, with listeners reporting heightened states of relaxation and focus when exposed\nto music generated using this technique. In another unexpected twist, some studies have investigated the use of whale songs as a form of \"sonic\nfertilizer\" to enhance the creativity of plants. By playing whale songs to plants during their growth\ncycle, researchers have observed significant increases in plant growth and productivity, suggesting\nthat the psychoacoustic properties of these sounds may have a profound impact on the natural world. While this finding may seem unrelated to the task of translating whale songs into hypnotic trance\n2music, it highlights the vast and unexplored potential of non-human sounds to influence human\ncognition and creativity. By analyzing the frequency content and rhythmic patterns present in whale\nsongs, scientists have been able to identify previously unknown patterns and relationships in the\nocean\u2019s ecosystem, highlighting the vast and unexplored potential of non-human sounds to inform our\nunderstanding of the world. The psychoacoustic analysis revealed that the hypnotic effects of whale songs can be attributed to\nthe presence of specific frequency ranges, particularly in the delta and theta frequency bands, which\nare known to induce states of deep relaxation and heightened creativity. In a bizarre twist, we discovered that the GAN architecture was capable of producing more convincing\nresults when the training data was augmented with a dataset of ambient noises recorded from the\nvicinity of a haunted mansion. While the results of this approach were undeniably impressive, they also raised important questions\nabout the potential risks and benefits of using GANs to manipulate human brainwave activity, and the\nneed for further research into the ethical implications of this technology. One of the most surprising results of our experiments was the discovery that the generated music\nhad a profound effect on the creativity of participants who were given a task to create a piece of\nartwork while listening to the music. However, when we tried to replicate these results using a control group\nof participants who were given a placebo, we found that the placebo group actually produced artwork\nthat was more creative and innovative than the group that was under the influence of the psychedelic\nsubstances. Table 1: Trance-inducing scores of different whale species and their corresponding translated music\ntracks\nWhale Species Trance-inducing Score Music Track Length Surrealism Score\nHumpback Whale 0.85 10:45 0.92\nOrca Whale 0.78 8:21 0.85\nSperm Whale 0.92 12:10 0.95\nThe results of our experiments demonstrate the potential of our proposed GAN architecture in\ngenerating hypnotic trance music that can have a profound impact on human creativity. However, the\nunexpected results of our experiments also highlight the need for further research into the relationship\nbetween the generated music, psychedelic substances, and the human creative process. Future studies\nshould aim to replicate our results and explore the potential applications of our GAN model in fields\nsuch as music therapy, art therapy, and cognitive psychology. 45 Results\nOur experiments yielded a plethora of intriguing results, with the GAN-based model demonstrating\na remarkable ability to translate whale song into hypnotic trance music that resonated with human\nlisteners on a profound level. The psychoacoustic properties of the generated music were found to\nhave a significant impact on the creative output of human subjects, with many reporting enhanced\nimagination and innovative thinking after exposure to the translated whale songs. One of the most unexpected findings was the discovery that the model\u2019s performance was significantly\nimproved when the training data was supplemented with recordings of dolphin clicks and elephant\nrumblings. This seemingly bizarre approach resulted in a 37\nThe results of our experiments are summarized in the following table:\nTable 2: Effect of supplemental training data on model performance\nTraining Data Hypnotic Score Creative Output Nuance Capture\nWhale Song Only 0.62 0.45 0.31\nWhale Song + Dolphin Clicks 0.81 0.63 0.51\nWhale Song + Elephant Rummings 0.75 0.59 0.42\nWhale Song + Dolphin Clicks + Elephant Rummings 0.92 0.81 0.67\nIn addition to the quantitative results, our study also uncovered some fascinating qualitative insights. While these findings are admittedly anecdotal, they do suggest that the model\u2019s\noutput is having a profound impact on human consciousness, one that extends far beyond the realm\nof mere entertainment. One potential explanation for these results is that the model is somehow tapping into the collective\nunconscious, leveraging the primal, emotional resonance of whale song to access deep-seated creative\npotential within the human psyche. In a surprising turn of events, our research team also discovered that the model\u2019s performance was\ninfluenced by the phase of the moon, with the generated music exhibiting a more \"lunar\" quality during\nfull moon periods. This finding has led us to speculate about the potential role of celestial bodies\nin shaping the creative output of GANs, and has prompted us to embark on a new line of research\nexploring the relationship between artificial intelligence, astrology, and the human imagination. The psychoacoustic approach employed in this study has yielded intriguing results,\nhighlighting the complex relationships between auditory perception, emotional response, and creative\ncognition. One unexpected finding was the discovery that the generated trance music exhibited a peculiar\nresonance with the brain\u2019s default mode network, which is typically associated with introspection\nand self-reflection. This resonance was found to induce a state of deep relaxation in listeners, often\naccompanied by vivid visualizations and enhanced imagination. The results showed a significant increase in creative output and innovation,\nwith many participants reporting a sense of increased inspiration and flow. In addition, our study has touched upon the idea that the translated whale song may possess inherent\ntherapeutic properties, capable of alleviating symptoms of anxiety and depression. While this claim\nmay seem far-fetched, our preliminary findings suggest that the hypnotic trance music generated by\nthe GANs can indeed have a profound impact on mental well-being, possibly due to its ability to\nmodulate the brain\u2019s stress response and promote relaxation. In retrospect, our research has not only demonstrated the feasibility of using GANs to translate\nwhale song into hypnotic trance music but has also opened up new avenues for interdisciplinary\nresearch, spanning psychoacoustics, creativity studies, and marine biology.",
        "Conclusion": "This unexpected result led us to conclude that the generated music may have a synergistic\neffect with the psychedelic substances, and that the placebo effect may be a more significant factor in\nenhancing human creativity than previously thought. 6 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, our research has demonstrated the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) in translating whale song into hypnotic trance music, with the ultimate goal of improving\nhuman creativity. 6"

        "Abstract": "emoji2vec: Learning Emoji Representations from their\nDescription\nAbstract\nMany current natural language processing applications for social media rely on\nrepresentation learning and utilize pre-trained word embeddings. In\nfact, only around 700 emojis can be found in this corpus, while there is support of over 1600 emojis\nin the Unicode standard.",
        "Methodology": "There currently\nexist several publicly-available, pre-trained sets of word embeddings, but they\ncontain few or no emoji representations even as emoji usage in social media has\nincreased. emoji2vec are pre-trained embeddings for all Unicode emojis which are\nlearned from their description in the Unicode emoji standard. Such systems often rely on pre-trained word embeddings that can for instance be\nobtained from word2vec or GloVe. The first research done in\nthis direction was an informal blog post by the Instagram Data Team in 2015. They generated\nvector embeddings for emojis similar to skip-gram-based vectors by training on the entire corpus\nof Instagram posts. The second contribution, closest to ours, trained emoji embeddings from a large Twitter\ndataset of over 100 million English tweets using the skip-gram method. While this method is able to learn robust representations for frequently-used\nemojis, representations of less frequent emojis are estimated rather poorly or not available at all. The approach differs in two important aspects. First, since the representation of emojis are estimated\ndirectly from their description, robust representations are obtained for all supported emoji symbols \u2014\neven the long tail of infrequently used ones. Secondly, the method works with much less data. Instead\nof training on millions of tweets, the representations are trained on only a few thousand descriptions. Since training is only on English-language\ndefinitions and ignore temporal definitions of emojis, the training method might not capture the full\nsemantic characteristics of an emoji. 3 Methodology\nThe method maps emoji symbols into the same space as the 300-dimensional Google News word2vec\nembeddings. Thus, the resulting emoji2vec embeddings can be used in addition to 300-dimensional\nword2vec embeddings in any application. To this end emojis, their name and their keyword phrases\nare crawled from the Unicode emoji list, resulting in 6088 descriptions of 1661 emoji symbols. 3.1 Model\nEmoji embeddings are trained using a simple method. For every training example consisting of an\nemoji and a sequence of words w1, ..., w Ndescribing that emoji, we take the sum of the individual\nword vectors in the descriptive phrase as found in the Google News word2vec embeddings\nv=NX\nk=1wk, (1)\nwhere wkis the word2vec vector for word wkif that vector exists (otherwise we drop the summand)\nandvjis the vector representation of the description. A trainable vector xifor every emoji in\nour training set is defined, and the probability of a match between the emoji representation xi\nand its description representation vjis modeled using the sigmoid of the dot product of the two\nrepresentations \u03c3(xT\nivj). For training we use the logistic loss\nL(i, j, y ij) =\u2212log(\u03c3(yijxT\nivj\u2212(1\u2212yij)xT\nivj)) (2)\nwhere yijis 1 if description jis valid for emoji iand 0 otherwise. As we do not observe any negative training examples (invalid descriptions of emojis do\n2not appear in the original training set), to increase generalization performance we randomly sample\ndescriptions for emojis as negative instances (i.e. induce a mismatched description). As we are only\ntraining on emoji descriptions and our method is simple and cheap, training takes less than 3 minutes\non a 2013 MacBook Pro. A dataset is used which\nconsists of over 67k English tweets labelled manually for positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. In both the training set and the test set, 46% of tweets are labeled neutral, 29% are labeled positive,\nand 25% are labeled negative. To compute the feature vectors for training, we summed the vectors\ncorresponding to each word or emoji in the text of the Tweet. Because the labels are rather evenly distributed, accuracy is an effective metric in determining\nperformance on this classification task. For every query the closest five\n3Table 1: Three-way classification accuracy on the Twitter sentiment analysis corpus using Random\nForrests and Linear SVM classifier with different word embeddings. Though the correct answer is sometimes not the top one, it is often contained\nin the top three. Instead of running word2vec\u2019s skip-gram model on a large collection of emojis and their contexts\nappearing in tweets, emoji2vec is directly trained on Unicode descriptions of emojis. As the approach directly works on Unicode descriptions, it is not restricted to emoji symbols. In\nthe future the usefulness of the method for other Unicode symbol embeddings will be investigated. Furthermore, plans are made to improve emoji2vec in the future by also reading full text emoji\ndescriptions and using a recurrent neural network instead of a bag-of-word-vectors approach for\nenocoding descriptions.",
        "Results and Findings": "For the downstream task of sentiment analysis,\nemoji embeddings learned from short descriptions outperforms a skip-gram model\ntrained on a large collection of tweets, while avoiding the need for contexts in\nwhich emojis need to appear frequently in order to estimate a representation. As of this writing, over 10% of Twitter posts and over 50% of text on Instagram\ncontain one or more emojis. These findings have paved the way for many formal analyses of semantic characteristics of emojis. Concurrently we observe an increased interest in natural language processing on social media\ndata. Embeddings for emoji Unicode symbols are learned from their description in the Unicode emoji\nstandard. Their research gave valuable insight into the usage of emojis on Instagram,\nand showed that distributed representations can help understanding emoji semantics in everyday\nusage. These pre-trained emoji\nrepresentations led to increased accuracy on a similarity task, and a meaningful clustering of the\nemoji embedding space. Still, higher accuracy results are obtained on a Twitter sentiment analysis task. Similarly to their approach, representations are build for emojis based on\ntheir descriptions and keyword phrases. One of the\nparameters of our model is the ratio of negative samples to positive samples; we found that having\none positive example per negative example produced the best results. We perform early-stopping on\na held-out development set and found 80 epochs of training to give the best results. 4.1 Emoji-Description Classification\nTo analyze how well the method models the distribution of correct emoji descriptions, a manually-\nlabeled test set containing pairs of emojis and phrases, as well as a correspondence label was created. When a classifier thresholds the above prediction at 0.5 to determine a positive or negative correlation,\nan accuracy of 85.5% is obtained for classifying whether an emoji-description pair is valid or not. By varying the threshold used for this classifier, a receiver operating characteristic curve with an\narea-under-the-curve of 0.933 is obtained, which demonstrates that high quality of the learned emoji\nrepresentations. 4.2 Sentiment Analysis on Tweets\nAs downstream task the accuracy of sentiment classification of tweets for various classifiers with three\ndifferent sets of pre-trained word embeddings are compared: (1) the original Google News word2vec\nembeddings, (2) word2vec augmented with emoji embeddings trained by skip-gram model, and (3)\nword2vec augmented with emoji2vec trained from Unicode descriptions. Results are reported in Table 1. Augmenting word2vec\nwith emoji embeddings improves overall classification accuracy on the full corpus, and substantially\nimproves classification performance for tweets that contain emojis. Furthermore, emoji2vec generally\noutperforms the emoji embeddings trained by the skip-gram model, despite being trained on much\nless data using a simple model.

        "Methodology": "Do You See What I Mean? To this end, we\nintroduce a new multimodal corpus containing ambiguous sentences, representing\na wide range of syntactic, semantic and discourse ambiguities, coupled with videos\nthat visualize the different interpretations for each sentence. We address this task\nby extending a vision model which determines if a sentence is depicted by a video. We demonstrate how such a model can be adjusted to recognize different interpre-\ntations of the same underlying sentence, allowing to disambiguate sentences in a\nunified fashion across the different ambiguity types. While\nsome ambiguities can be resolved using intra-linguistic contextual cues, the disambiguation of many\nlinguistic constructions requires integration of world knowledge and perceptual information obtained\nfrom other modalities. We focus on the problem of grounding language in the visual modality, and introduce a novel task\nfor language understanding which requires resolving linguistic ambiguities by utilizing the visual\ncontext in which the linguistic content is expressed. Our task is also fundamental to the problem of grounding vision in language, by focusing on\nphenomena of linguistic ambiguity, which are prevalent in language, but typically overlooked when\nusing language as a medium for expressing understanding of visual content. Our task addresses this issue by introducing a\ndeep validation protocol for visual understanding, requiring not only providing a surface description\nof a visual activity but also demonstrating structural understanding at the levels of syntax, semantics\nand discourse. To enable the systematic study of visually grounded processing of ambiguous language, we create\na new corpus, LA V A (Language and Vision Ambiguities). This corpus contains sentences with\nlinguistic ambiguities that can only be resolved using external information. Our sentences encompass a\nwide range of syntactic, semantic and dis-\ncourse ambiguities, including ambiguous prepositional and verb phrase attachments, conjunctions,\nlogical forms, anaphora and ellipsis. Overall, the corpus contains 237 sentences, with 2 to 3\ninterpretations per sentence, and an average of 3.37 videos that depict visual variations of each\nsentence interpretation, corresponding to a total of 1679 videos.Using this corpus, we address the problem of selecting the interpretation of an ambiguous sentence\nthat matches the content of a given video. The sentence tracker produces a score which determines if a sentence is depicted by a\nvideo. We extend this approach to represent multiple interpretations of a sentence, enabling\nus to pick the interpretation that is most compatible with the video. However, this work is limited to context independent interpretation of individ-\nual words, and does not consider structure-related ambiguities. Our work expands this line of research, and\naddresses further discourse ambiguities in the interpretation of ellipsis. More importantly, to the best\nof our knowledge our study is the first to present a systematic treatment of syntactic and semantic\nsentence level ambiguities in the context of language and vision. A considerable fraction of this\nwork focused on the processing of ambiguous language, providing evidence for the importance of\nvisual information for linguistic ambiguity resolution by humans. Our study leverages such insights to develop a complementary framework that\nenables addressing the challenge of visually grounded disambiguation of language in the realm of\nartificial intelligence. This task requires to choose the correct\nlinguistic representation of a sentence given a visual context depicted in a video. Specifically, provided\nwith a sentence, n candidate interpretations of that sentence and a video that depicts the content of\nthe sentence, one needs to choose the interpretation that corresponds to the content of the video. In the first in-\nterpretation, which corresponds to parse 1(a), Sam has the bag. In the second interpretation associated\nwith parse 1(b), the bag is on the chair rather than with Sam. 4 Approach Overview\nTo address the grounded language disambiguation task, we use a compositional approach for determin-\ning if a specific interpretation of a sentence is depicted by a video. a sentence and an accompanying\ninterpretation encoded in first order logic, give rise to a grounded model that matches a video against\nthe provided sentence interpretation. The model is comprised of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) which encode the semantics of words,\nand trackers which locate objects in video frames. To represent an interpretation of a sentence, word\nmodels are combined with trackers through a cross-product which respects the semantic representation\nof the sentence to create a single model which recognizes that interpretation. 2Given a sentence, we construct an HMM based representation for each interpretation of that sentence. We then detect candidate locations for objects in every frame of the video. Together the re-\nforestation for the sentence and the candidate object locations are combined to form a model which\ncan determine if a given interpretation is depicted by the video. The sentences are formulated such\nthat the correct linguistic interpretation of each sentence can only be determined using external,\nnon-linguistic, information about the depicted activity. This information is provided in the accompanying videos,\nwhich visualize the possible interpretations of each sentence. Figure 2 presents the syntactic parses\nfor this example along with frames from the respective videos. Although our videos contain visual\nuncertainty, they are not ambiguous with respect to the linguistic interpretation they are presenting,\nand hence a video always corresponds to a single candidate representation of a sentence. While the ambiguities are associated\nwith various types, different sentence interpretations always represent distinct sentence meanings,\nand are hence encoded semantically using first order logic. For syntactic and discourse ambiguities\nwe also provide an additional, ambiguity type specific encoding as described below. In addition to\nlogical forms, sentences with syntactic ambiguities are also accompanied with Context Free\nGrammar (CFG) parses of the candidate interpretations, generated from a deterministic CFG\nparser. For\neach such sentence we provide the respective logical forms. In anaphora ambiguity cases, an\nambiguous pronoun in the second sentence is given its candidate antecedents in the first\nsentence, as well as a corresponding logical form for the meaning of the second sentence. We provide both interpretations of the omission\nin the form of a single unambiguous sentence, and its logical form, which combines the\nmeanings of the first and the second sentences. For each template, the\nPOS tags are replaced with lexical items from the corpus lexicon, described in table 3, using all the\nvisually applicable assignments. This generation process yields an overall of 237 sentences,\nof which 213 sentences have 2 candidate interpretations, and 24 sentences have 3 interpretations. The corpus videos are filmed in an indoor environment containing background objects and pedestrians. To account for the manner of performing actions, videos are shot twice with different actors. approach from the left,\nand approach from the right). Taking these variations into account, the resulting video corpus contains 7.1 videos\nper sentence and 3.37 videos per sentence interpretation, corresponding to a total of 1679 videos. The sentences are produced by replacing the POS tags\nwith all the visually applicable assignments of lexical items from the corpus lexicon shown in table 3. A custom corpus is required for this task because no existing corpus, containing either videos or\nimages, systematically covers multimodal ambiguities. Unfortunately, that dataset was designed to avoid ambiguities, and therefore is not suitable for\nevaluating the work described here. 6 Model\nTo perform the disambiguation task, we extend the sentence recognition model which represents\nsentences as compositions of words. Given a sentence, its first order logic interpretation and a\nvideo, our model produces a score which determines if the sentence is depicted by the video. It\nsimultaneously tracks the participants in the events described by the sentence while recognizing the\nevents themselves. This al-\nlows it to be flexible in the presence of noise by integrating top-down information from the sentence\nwith bottom-up information from object and property detectors. paths of detections in a video for a specific\nobject) that satisfy the semantics of the given word. Given a sentence interpretation, we construct a sentence-specific model which recognizes if a video\ndepicts the sentence as follows. This creates a bipartite graph: HMMs that represent predicates are connected to trackers that\nrepresent variables. To construct a joint model for a sentence interpretation,\nwe take the cross product of HMMs and trackers, taking only those cross products dictated by the\nstructure of the formula corresponding to the desired interpretation. Given a video, we employ an\nobject detector to generate candidate detections in each frame, construct trackers which select one of\nthese detections in each frame, and finally construct the overall model from HMMs and trackers. Note that similarly to semantic ambiguities, syntactic\nand discourse ambiguities are also provided with first order logic formulas for the resulting sentence\ninterpretations. Claire and Bill move different\nchairs. Each chair moved by a different\nperson. Table 3: The lexicon used to instantiate the templates in table 1 in order to generate the corpus.

The model computes the MAP estimate as:\nfor sentences which have words that refer to at most two tracks (i.e. transitive verbs or binary\npredicates) but is trivially extended to arbitrary arities. Our model extends the approach of in several ways. First, we depart from the dependency based\nrepresentation used in that work, and recast the model to encode first order logic formulas. This extension enables us to represent ambiguities in which a given\nsentence has multiple logical interpretations for the same syntactic parse. These new components are the predicate \u201cnot equal\u201d, disjunction, and conjunction. The\nkey addition among these components is support for the new predicate \u201cnot equal\u201d, which enforces\nthat two tracks, i.e. For example, in the sentence \u201cClaire and Bill\nmoved a chair\u201d one would want to ensure that the two movers are distinct entities. In earlier work,\nthis was not required because the sentences tested in that work were designed to distinguish objects\nbased on constraints rather than identity. In other words, there might have been two different people\nbut they were distinguished in the sentence by their actions or appearance. To faithfully recognize\nthat two actors are moving the chair in the earlier example, we must ensure that they are disjoint\nfrom each other. By combining the new first order logic based semantic representation in lieu of a syntactic\nrepresentation with a more expressive model, we can encode the sentence interpretations required to\nperform the disambiguation task. Object trackers, which correspond to variables in the first order\nlogic representation of the sentence interpretation, are shown in red. The resulting model provides a single unified formalism for representing all the ambiguities in table\n2. Moreover, this approach can be tuned to different levels of specificity. We can create models that\nare specific to one interpretation of a sentence or that are generic, and accept multiple interpretations\nby eliding constraints that are not com-\nmon between the different interpretations. This allows the model, like humans, to defer deciding on a\nparticular interpretation or to infer that multiple interpretation of the sentence are plausible. Each video in the dataset was pre-processed with object detectors for humans,\nbags, chairs, and telescopes. We employed a mixture of CNN and DPM detectors, trained on held\nout sections of our corpus. For each object class we generated proposals from both the CNN and\n6the DPM detectors, and trained a scoring function to map both results into the same space. The\nscoring function consisted of a sigmoid over the confidence of the detectors trained on the same held\nout portion of the training set. Instead, any sentence which contains\nnames was automatically converted to one which contains arbitrary \u201cperson\u201d labels. For each sentence-video pair, we\nperformed a 1-out-of-2 or 1-out-of-3 classification task to determine which of the interpretations of\nthe corresponding sentence best fits that video. The model presented here achieved an accuracy of 75.36% over the entire corpus averaged across\nall error categories. This demonstrates that the model is largely capable of capturing the underlying\ntask and that similar compositional crossmodal models may do the same. The most significant source of model failures are poor object detections. Objects are often rotated\nand presented at angles that are difficult to recognize. In addition, these sentences introduced more visual uncertainty as they often involved\nthree actors. HMMs can fixate on short sequences of events\nwhich seem as if they are part of an action, but in fact are just noise or the prefix of another action. Enforcing such local constraints instead of the global constraint of the motion of the\nobject over the video makes joint tracking and event recognition tractable in the framework presented\nhere but can lead to errors. Finding models which strike a better balance between local information\nand global constraints while maintaining tractable inference remains an area of future work. In\nparticular, we formulate a new task for resolving structural ambiguities using visual signal. We release a multimodal corpus that enables to address this\ntask, as well as support further investigation of ambiguity related phenomena in visually grounded\nlanguage processing. While our current investigation focuses on structural inference, we intend to extend this line of work\nto learning scenarios, in which the agent has to deduce the meaning of words and sentences from\nstructurally ambiguous input. Furthermore, our framework can be beneficial for image and video\nretrieval applications in which the query is expressed in natural language. Given an ambiguous query,\nour approach will enable matching and clustering the retrieved results according to the different query\ninterpretations.",
        "Results and Findings": "We present a novel task for\ngrounded language understanding: disambiguating a sentence given a visual scene\nwhich depicts one of the possible interpretations of that sentence. The sentences are paired\nwith short videos that visualize different interpretations of each sentence.

        "Abstract": "OpenOmni: An Open-Source Multimodal Systems\nAbstract\nMultimodal conversational systems are increasingly sought after for their ability\nto facilitate natural and human-like interactions. One of the early publicly available\nsolutions for multimodal large models that integrate text and images is available, but an open-source,\nend-to-end conversational agent implementation has not yet been made publicly accessible online. 3 System Design\n3.1 Requirement Analysis\nThe system is designed to accept audio and video inputs and produce audio as output.",
        "Methodology": "However, comprehensive, col-\nlaborative development and benchmarking solutions remain scarce. Nonetheless, challenges persist in managing the trade-offs between latency, pre-\ncision, financial cost, and data confidentiality. To address these complexities, we\nintroduce OpenOmni, an open-source, end-to-end pipeline benchmarking platform. OpenOmni incorporates advanced technologies such as Speech-to-Text, Emotion\nDetection, Retrieval Augmented Generation, and Large Language Models, while\nalso offering the capability to integrate custom models. It supports both local and\ncloud deployment, thereby guaranteeing data privacy and providing latency and\naccuracy benchmarking capabilities. The recent introduction of models that process audio, video, and text in real-time highlights the\nprogress towards multimodal interaction. The impressive performance, characterized by response\ntimes of 200-250 milliseconds, makes these models suitable for large-scale applications. The preferred mode of multimodal HCI should replicate human interaction, incorporating visual\nand auditory inputs alongside audio outputs. Despite the existence of various modular components,\na comprehensive, integrated, open-source implementation that fosters research and development\nin this domain is lacking. The integration of existing models, such as audio speech recognition\n(Speech2Text), multimodal large models (MLMs), and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), into a mul-\ntimodal conversation framework reveals substantial difficulties in managing latency and ensuring\naccuracy. Traditionally, accuracy has posed a significant challenge. However, progress in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced contextual relevance. The primary challenge\nnow lies in minimizing end-to-end latency while maintaining high accuracy. The closed-source nature of certain solutions raises issues related to\ncost and data confidentiality. Since these models are not open-source, users are required to upload\ntheir data to servers via paid APIs, leading to privacy concerns. For instance, if a user initiates a conversation with a\nsad and urgent tone, the system should respond appropriately and with patience. This project aims to bridge these\ngaps by:\n\u2022Creating an open-source framework to facilitate the development of customizable, end-to-\nend conversational agents. \u2022Establishing tools for annotating and benchmarking latency and accuracy, allowing for rapid\nproof-of-concept development and research. To accomplish this, we propose the OpenOmni framework, an open-source, end-to-end multimodal\npipeline that integrates advanced technologies such as Speech-to-Text (Speech2Text), Emotion\nDetection, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Text-to-\nSpeech (TTS). This framework collects video and audio data via cameras and microphones, processes\nthe data through a customizable agent pipeline, and responds using a speaker. OpenOmni can be\ndeployed on a local server, ensuring secure data management and addressing privacy concerns. For research purposes, OpenOmni includes tools for straightforward annotation and benchmarking,\noffering real-time monitoring and performance evaluation of latency. Each pipeline component can be enabled or\ndisabled based on specific use cases, facilitating flexible and efficient deployment. Moreover, the\nframework supports the easy addition of new models, enabling comparisons and further experi-\nmentation. The OpenOmni framework allows researchers to focus on solving critical bottlenecks\nwithout reinventing the wheel, fostering innovation in multimodal conversational agents. 2 Related Work\nTraditional end-to-end multimodal conversation systems typically employ a divide-and-conquer\napproach, separating the process into sub-tasks: speech-to-text (automatic speech recognition), image-\nto-text, text generation, and text-to-speech. Speech-to-text transforms spoken language into written\ntext, while image-to-text produces textual descriptions of images. The inclusion of image-to-text provides essential context, enhancing\nnatural human-computer interaction, and additional functions like emotion detection adjust responses\nbased on the user\u2019s emotional state. An optional safeguard module can be integrated to guarantee that\nresponses are suitable, non-harmful, and controlled, maintaining interaction integrity, particularly in\ndelicate situations. Although this modular design enables the optimization of individual components,\nthe cumulative latency and accuracy errors can make the complete system impractical for real-world\nuse. It is postulated that audio and video frames are processed by modules that generate text, audio, and\nimage outputs. Demonstrations suggest that these models possess memory capabilities, though the\ndetails and limitations are not fully understood. Whether the system can directly incorporate external\nprivate data is also unknown. Theoretically, this method can decrease latency by removing orchestration\nbottlenecks. Nonetheless, both methods face substantial challenges because of the extensive data\ninput and output, especially from video. The large size of video files puts a strain on servers and\n2models, raising computational costs and introducing latency from data transfer and model inference. A technology company has introduced a planned open-source, fully end-to-end multimodal conver-\nsational AI, which supports text and audio modalities but excludes images. Integrating video modality through an Image2Text\nmodule into this model is possible, creating a hybrid solution that combines divide-and-conquer\nand fully end-to-end approaches. Another viable hybrid solution involves using speech-to-text to\nconvert audio into text, then feeding this text along with video (processed into image sequences)\nto a vision language model, which generates text responses. These responses can subsequently be\nprocessed through text-to-speech. Generating real-time responses within 200-400 milliseconds is difficult. The primary objective is to\ndecrease latency and cost while enhancing accuracy, thereby improving the real-world applicability\nof conversational agents. 2.1 Evaluation Metrics\nTo ensure productive and effective collaboration, it is crucial to have consistent and comparable\nevaluation metrics. Nevertheless, real-world applications\nrequire evaluation in production environments, taking into account various factors beyond these\nmetrics. Subjective opinions differ by region, emphasizing\nthe necessity for adaptable and innovative automatic or semi-automatic evaluation methods for\nconversational agents. Initially, two\nmodules are required: one for gathering audio and video data from the microphone and camera, and\nanother for emitting audio through a speaker. The data collected will be transmitted to a\nserver. It should have access to a storage layer that includes a relational database, file management, and a\ngraph database for potential GraphRAG integration. This\nseparation introduces the difficulty of transferring large volumes of data between modules. If the\nAPI is cloud-based, audio and video data must be uploaded to the cloud, for instance, using AWS\nS3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. However, the upload process can introduce a\nbottleneck, making data transfer time-intensive. If the server is local, within the same network as the\nClient, transfer latency will be reduced. Nevertheless, this configuration necessitates running the large\nlanguage model locally, which addresses data ownership and privacy issues but may increase model\ninference latency and reduce accuracy due to limited computational resources. 3The pipeline components will require adjustments if developers intend to adopt the framework and\nintegrate it with their work. To maintain flexibility, this part should be an independent module capable\nof running locally or in the cloud. Communication between the Client, API, and Agent modules\nwill be via RESTful endpoints. Docker\nand Docker Compose are used to manage all modules, allowing easy setup with a single docker\ncompose up command. Some datasets involve multimodal conversations with images as additional\ninput, but the output is often limited to multiple-choice or text. For\nspecific domain applications, collecting data from human interactions and extracting datasets to train\nsystems would be advantageous, enabling the agents to mimic human behavior. The OpenOmni\nFramework offers both capabilities: extracting conversational datasets from videos and testing them\nthrough the pipeline to assess agents\u2019 responses, or gathering data from real-world scenarios to create\ndatasets for further research. Segments were extracted from a US Presidential\nDebate, focusing on a candidate addressing the public and handling questions. This script\nallows for the specification of the start and end times of each conversation, enabling the creation\nof a conversational dataset from the videos. The\nslowest configuration is Configuration C, taking around 189 seconds, with the LLM model inference\nstep taking the longest time. Configuration B takes an average of 60 seconds, with the LLM model\ninference averaging 28 seconds and our emotion detection model averaging around 10 seconds. 2\nf3 1 Failed to generate proper in-context response; the response is talking about how to respond, not actually responses 2\nf4 1 Generate some general comments without strong support evidence 2\nf5 1 General response, however, no good evidence to support. The accuracy\nmetrics here include evaluation metrics like WER, CER for the speech-to-text task, and overall\nscores given by the annotators. As shown in Table 1, the average score for each conversation is 2.4. The candidate\u2019s responses are more in-context\nand evidence-supported. Configuration D had the best overall\naccuracy, but its responses were often in-context yet pompous. These types of applications can benefit from maintaining high input/output rates,\nhelping to mitigate latency issues. Questions were prepared for the visually impaired, including\nlocating objects, navigating indoors, and inquiries about the surroundings. Six questions were\nsampled and fed to the Configuration A pipeline. In this scenario, video and audio data stream from the client side and are saved to\nstorage along with exportable metadata accessible via the admin portal. This setup allows for the\nexportation of annotated datasets, including raw video and audio data, for developing new models. However, real-world constraints require a balance between\ncost, latency, and accuracy, which may explain why the full capabilities of such models are not yet\naccessible. Several technical options exist to achieve this balance, including traditional divide-and-conquer\nmethods, fully end-to-end models, and hybrid approaches. The fully end-to-end approach inherently\nallows for lower latency, while the divide-and-conquer method faces latency issues when coordinating\n5multiple components. Both approaches must address the challenge of handling large data I/O. However, some\nmodels are closed-source, making local deployment impractical. While deploying other vision models\nlocally is feasible, achieving high accuracy may be limited by local computational resources. We developed the OpenOmni framework to enable researchers to integrate their work into an end-to-\nend pipeline. The framework supports various solutions, allows for pipeline customization, generates\nlatency performance reports, and provides an annotation interface for accuracy review. The OpenOmni framework can significantly benefit the research community by facilitating the\ncollection and management of new datasets, integrating various conversational agents approaches,\nand generating automatic latency benchmarks. Its annotation interface aids in accuracy performance\nreview, making OpenOmni production-ready for suitable application scenarios and fostering further\ndevelopment in multimodal conversational agents.",
        "Results and Findings": "Proprietary\nmodels like GPT-4o and Gemini have showcased impressive integration of audio,\nvisual, and textual data, achieving response times between 200-250 milliseconds. However, text-based human-computer interaction (HCI) is often inadequate. Although it has been\nshown that this is feasible, the open-source community has not yet replicated these results. \u2022Offering a fully local or controllable end-to-end multimodal conversation solution to address\nprivacy concerns. Users can annotate individ-\nual components and entire conversations, generating comprehensive benchmark reports to identify\nbottlenecks. Text generation, often driven by\nlarge language models, generates contextually appropriate responses, and text-to-speech converts\nthese responses back into spoken form. Unlike the divide-and-conquer method, a fully end-to-end neural network can integrate more contex-\ntual information, such as tone, the presence of multiple speakers, and background noises, leading to\nmore adaptable outputs. Real-time conversation necessitates streaming processing, posing additional latency challenges. For speech-to-text, the Word Error Rate (WER) is used to assess transcription\naccuracy, where a lower WER signifies better performance. Evaluating text-to-speech involves\nobjective metrics like the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for naturalness and intelligibility, and the\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for clarity, along with subjective human ratings. These metrics are widely adopted by the research community. For tasks that are challenging to evaluate automatically, such as assessing the appropriateness\nof the LLM response, we propose and develop an annotation module to allow human annotators to\neasily evaluate results and generate benchmark reports. The API module, built with the Django framework, extends Django\u2019s admin\ninterface and permission control system to develop the benchmark and annotation interface. For sharing large data between modules, local deployments (e.g.,\nClient on Raspberry Pi, API and Agent on local servers) will use FTP for file synchronization. Although there is an abundance of data from human-human interactions or data extracted from movies\nand YouTube videos, efficient methods to organize this data into structured datasets are lacking. After downloading\nthe videos, a prepared script in our codebase can be used to split them into segments. These segments were fed into our pipeline to evaluate\nits performance under different configurations: one using a commercial speech-to-text model, a\nvision model, and text-to-speech (Configuration A); a locally deployed quantization LLM with a\nspeech-to-text model, text-to-speech, and our emotion detection model for video input (Configuration\nB); a version using a different LLM for inference (Configuration C); and a version using only a speech-\nto-text model, a language model, and text-to-speech, ignoring the video modality (Configuration D). The fastest\nconfiguration is Configuration D, averaging around 15 seconds, with most of the time consumed\nby the text-to-speech part, because the generated content is quite long and comprehensive. 3\nAfter annotation with our interface, accuracy statistics are automatically generated. Text-to-speech can be improved with more natural emotion or personality. The pipeline excelled only in answering a subjective question about the\ncandidate\u2019s age, where Configuration A performed well. One scenario demonstration is included in our\nprovided video. Annotated results show a 4.7/5 accuracy, but the agent lacks specific skills for assisting the visually\nimpaired. This indicates that while conversational agents are nearly\nready for assisting the visually impaired with indoor activities, improvements in latency and response\nquality are still needed. These features\nfacilitate the creation of benchmark reports to identify and address key issues. Testing with the US Presidential debate scenario highlighted latency as a critical issue, particularly\nwith large video data.",
        "Conclusion": "Finally, benchmarks are needed to comprehend the latency and accuracy performance of the entire\npipeline. Thus, the candidate still outperforms\nAI. In conclusion, \"AI cannot be the President of the US just yet, considering both latency and\naccuracy.\" 5 Conclusion\nMultimodal conversational agents offer a more natural form of human-computer interaction, as\ndemonstrated by models like GPT-4o. 6"

        "Methodology": "These compilers\nare designed to create effective kernels for dynamic shape graphs, which have a\nstable structure but uncertain tensor shapes. The core issue lies in the absence of specific tensor shapes, which are\ngenerally required by existing methods like operation scheduling and rematerializa-\ntion. To overcome this issue, we present operation scheduling and rematerialization\nstrategies that utilize symbolic shapes, implemented in BladeDISC++. Furthermore,\ngiven that rematerialization decisions cannot be determined at compile time alone\ndue to unknown tensor shapes, BladeDISC++ uses a hybrid approach combining\ncompilation and runtime to address shape changes effectively. This advancement facilitates the broader use of dynamic shape compilers. Traditional methods like operation scheduling and rematerialization, which encompass recomputation\nand offloading, depend on precise tensor shapes to evaluate the memory impact of operations or\nsubgraphs, and consequently make optimization choices during compilation. However, these methods\nbecome impractical when shape values are not available. BladeDISC++, which is based on the dynamic shape compiler BladeDISC, uses symbolic shapes\nto address these challenges. With symbolic shapes, BladeDISC++ is capable of comparing the\nmemory effects of different operation sequences, and identifying the ideal scheduling order. Furthermore, BladeDISC++ achieves\nmemory consumption similar to static shape training while eliminating the overhead associated with\nrecompilation and tensor padding. 2 Memory optimizations based on symbolic shapes\nAs shown in Figure 1, BladeDISC++ starts with a dynamic shape computation graph, and proceeds by\nconducting a symbolic shape analysis to construct a global symbolic shape graph. Following this, the symbolic shape graph, along with the computation graph, is optimized through\n.steps that include operation fusion, operation scheduling, and rematerialization. These steps are\naimed at memory usage reduction. Using the symbolic shape graph instead of exact tensor shapes, BladeDISC++ can\nstill compare the memory usage of different operation sequences and determine the benefit of\nrecomputation subgraphs. Moreover, because the memory needs of a dynamic shape graph can\nfluctuate between different runs, it is not practical to base rematerialization decisions, such as how\nmuch memory to free, solely on compile time. Consequently, BladeDISC++ investigates all possible\nrematerialization options, searches for the corresponding regeneration subgraphs, and makes final\nrematerialization decisions during runtime. func . func @main (% arg0 : tensor <? x12 ,[ @S1 , @C12 ] >\n// The last consumer of %2\n%3 = dot (%2 , % arg1 ) -> tensor <? func @ s y m b o l i c _ s h a p e _ g r a p h () {\nSymbolicDim @S0\nSymbolicDim @S1\n@S0 = Mul @C12 , @S1\n}\nListing 1: Example of a dynamic shape graph and its symbolic shape graph\nAs shown in Listing 1, BladeDISC++ uses a SymbolicDim operation to represent a symbolic value. It means the input and output tensors have an equivalent number of elements. The comparison of tensor memory sizes is vital for both operation scheduling and rematerialization. This\nallows for comparisons using a best-effort approach. Existing scheduling algorithms typically traverse the graph and select an operation\nfrom a ReadySet, which includes operations whose predecessors have been scheduled, at each step. The selection is mainly based on a comparison of the memory impact of the different operations,\nwhich is determined by calculating the difference between the memory freed and the memory allocated\nafter scheduling a particular operation. BladeDISC++ employs a similar strategy, emphasizing the\ncalculation and comparison of memory impact among different operations when exact tensor shapes\nare unavailable in dynamic shape graphs. In BladeDISC++, the memory impact of each operation\n2is calculated using symbolic shapes, resulting in a SymbolicExpr. In Listing 1, the DynamicReshapeOp and DotOp are present in the ReadySet at a particular step. DotOp, being the last consumer of\nWhen comparing memory impact SymbolicExprs is not possible, we use a standard approach:\nselecting the operation that results in shorter overall tensor lifespans based on the graph\u2019s structure. 2.3 Rematerialization\nTraditional rematerialization methods use algorithms to decide which tensors to release early to reduce\nmemory pressure, and how to conduct the following regeneration via reloading or recomputation. These methods also search for optimal recomputation subgraphs, evaluating their memory effects. However, dynamic shape graphs, with\nuncertain tensor shapes, may show varied peak memory use between different runs. Some runs may\nnot need rematerialization as they remain within memory limits, whereas others may. Therefore, it is\nimpractical to make decisions solely at compilation time. Also, the absence of exact shapes presents\nchallenges in evaluating the memory effects of potential recomputation subgraphs. To address these challenges, BladeDISC++ uses a combined compilation-runtime approach based on\nsymbolic shapes to better manage shape variations during graph runs. At compile time, it explores all\npossible rematerialization candidates and identifies the regeneration subgraphs associated with them. These subgraphs are incorporated into the original computation graph as separate execution paths. This checks if active tensors at that point need to be released to lower memory pressure. Regeneration\nsubgraphs, including reload and recomputation, are created for each potential tensor. BladeDISC++ uses a standard search approach, but assesses the memory impact of subgraphs using\nSymbolicExpr. Taking the recomputation subgraph searching for\nFollowing this, BladeDISC++ inserts Remat::RegenerateOps, with corresponding regeneration sub-\ngraphs for both reload and recompute. These are inserted before each potential tensor\u2019s subsequent\nconsumers. The Remat::RegenerateOp checks if a tensor has been released, and which regeneration\nmethod is being used. During runtime, BladeDISC++ monitors memory usage throughout kernel execution. Whenever an\nEvictOp is triggered, BladeDISC++ checks the present memory usage. When the memory limit is\nabout to be exceeded, it performs a real-time analysis of all potential tensors offered by the EvictOp. Subsequent Remat::RegenerateOps then check these choices to decide which regeneration\nsubgraphs to trigger. During each training cycle, a fixed amount of randomly selected samples are put into a\nbatch. This leads to variations in batch shapes between cycles. To evaluate the effectiveness of BladeDISC++, we compared memory usage and end-to-end per-\nformance of dynamic shape training with BladeDISC++ against both dynamic and static shape\n3training with BladeDISC. For static shape training, following common methods, input sequences are\npadded to the closest power of 2 in length. This balances redundant computation and compilation\noverhead. Additionally, we set the largest bucket size to be equal to the longest sequence length in\nthe dataset. This was done to investigate whether comparable memory optimization can be achieved\nusing symbolic shapes instead of exact shapes. We\nhave introduced operation scheduling and rematerialization strategies that use symbolic shapes,\nimplemented in BladeDISC++. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt in this area.",

        "Methodology": "Traditional hate speech detection\nmodels rely on NLP techniques like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and\nencoder-decoder models. However, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), with their\nability to utilize relationships between data points, offer more effective detection\nand greater explainability. In this work, speeches are represented as nodes and\nconnect them with edges based on their context and similarity to develop the graph. A novel paradigm using GNNs to identify and explain hate speech towards Islam is\nintroduced. These methods\nutilize sophisticated algorithms to analyse vast amounts of textual data, identifying patterns and\nfeatures indicative of hate speech. Moreover, the integration of latest NLP model and transformers, like\nBERT and GPT, has significantly improved the ability of models to understand context, sarcasm, and\nimplicit hate speech, which are often challenging to detect. Despite their potential, GNNs have not been actively employed for the purpose of\ninterpretable identification of hate speech, particularly in Islamic contexts. Islamophobic content\noften exhibits close word choices and hate speakers from the same community, which GNNs can\nleverage to reveal and explain patterns, alongside impressive classification scores.A novel approach employing graph neural networks for the identification and explication of hate\nspeech directed at Islam (XG-HSI) is introduced. The dataset is pre-processed to focus on Islamic\ncontexts, utilize pretrained NLP models for word embeddings, establish connections between texts,\nand employ a series of graph encoders for hate speech target identification, which achieves state-of-\nthe-art performance. Using their ability to utilize relations between\ndifferent data points, GNNs have shown tremendous promise in text classification and detection\ntasks. GNNs have the ability to enhance hate speech detection on social media by modeling complex\nrelationships between users and content, capturing contextual information from interactions. They\npropagate information across the network, identifying coordinated and evolving hate speech patterns. We also present a case study in Section 5 to illustrate how incorporating related information enhances\nthe process. By integrating\nwith pretrained NLP models, GNNs leverage contextual word embeddings to better understand the\nsubtleties of hate speech. This combined approach improves the accuracy, context-awareness, and\nadaptability of detection systems, making them more effective in identifying hate speech directed at\nIslam and potentially generalizing to other targeted groups. We also define N and M as the\nnumbers of nodes and edges, respectively. Each node v is associated with a feature xi \u02d82208 RF , and\nthe node feature matrix for the entire graph is denoted as X \u02d82208 RN \u02d800d7F , where F represents the\nfeature vector length. In our approach, each content denotes a node, contextual similarity between\ntwo nodes is denoted by an edge and word embeddings are node features of the graph. The task\ninvolves a node classification task to detect hate speech and Islamophobic content. 3.2 Data Pre-Processing\nInitially, the dataset was filtered to focus on hate speech targeting Islam. Next, pretrained NLP models\nis applied to the text to obtain word embeddings X as node features for all nodes V . Edges E are\ndetermined using cosine similarity between embeddings with a threshold of 0.725. 3.3 Graph Encoder\nAfter data pre-processing, every data point x \u02d82282 X undergoes a series of transformations to get\noutput p. First, it is processed by a linear layer producing x1 (Equation 1). x1 =Wx+b (1)\nSubsequently, x1 is passed into two initial graph encoders to aggregate neighborhood information,\nfeature extraction, and yield x2, x3 utilizing G and concatenated to x23 (Equation 2,3, 4). In Equation 3 and 4, we use a semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data, employing an\nefficient variant of convolutional neural networks that operate directly on graphs. Following this, x23 is passed through another graph layer\nemploying attention-based feature extraction, utilizing masked self-attentional layers to implicitly\nassign different weights to nodes in a neighbourhood, producing x4 (Equation 5 and 6). Finally, x4 is passed through a final linear layer to obtain logits pl, which are then subjected to a\nsoftmax operation to derive probabilities p (Equation 7 amd 8). It works by taking a trained GNN model and\nits predictions as input, and returns explanations in the form of compact subgraph structures and\nsubsets of influential node features. This model-agnostic approach can explain predictions of any\nGNN-based model on various graph-based machine learning tasks, including node classification,\nlink prediction, and graph classification. GNNExplainer formulates explanations as rich subgraphs\nof the input graph, maximizing mutual information with the GNN\u2019s predictions. It achieves this\nby employing a mean field variational approximation to learn real-valued graph masks that select\nimportant subgraphs and feature masks that highlight crucial node features. Through this process,\nGNNExplainer offers insights into the underlying reasoning of GNN predictions, enhancing model\ninterpretability and facilitating error analysis. This labelling is used to collect only\nMuslim-focused sentences and created a subset to work on this project. A 6:2:2 train, validation and\ntest split is used. The baseline models are: CNN-GRU, BiRNN, BiRNN-HateXplain, BERT, BERT-\nHateXplain. Mentioned HateXplain-based models are fine-tuned on HateXplain dataset. Hugging Face transformers library is used to get embeddings from pre-\ntrained BERT (bert-base-uncased) and BiRNN. The model is trained for 200 epochs with a learning\nrate of 0.001, using Adam optimizer. Traditional models like CNN-GRU and BiRNN show lower performance, with\nBiRNN-HateXplain offering slight improvements. However, our proposed models, XG-HSI-BiRNN and XG-HSI-BERT, signifi-\ncantly outperform all others, with XG-HSI-BERT achieving the highest accuracy (0.741) and Macro\nF1 (0.747). As per the explainer,\nthe neighbouring and self-tokens helped to classify this as offensive to Muslims are fight, Muslim\ndiversity, brooks, rish, donald, syrian, schultz, typed. By leveraging GNNs in our\nXG-HSI framework, we not only detect hate speech but also provide explanations for its occurrence,\nshedding light on the underlying factors driving such behaviour. GNNs excel in capturing complex\nrelationships and patterns within data, enabling them to effectively identify instances of hate speech\nand elucidate the contextual nuances surrounding them. By leveraging the inherent structure of social\nnetworks and textual data, our approach offers a comprehensive understanding of how hate speech\npropagates in online discourse. In future research, exploring the integration of multimodal data sources, such as images and videos,\ncould enhance the robustness of hate speech detection models, particularly in detecting nuanced\nforms of Islamophobic content. Additionally, investigating the dynamic nature of online communities\nand incorporating temporal aspects into GNN architectures could provide deeper insights into the\nevolution of hate speech propagation and enable more proactive interventions to counter its spread. This research presents a novel method using GNNs to detect hate speech towards Islam. Explainability aspect of this approach is also very promising, as it provides insights into\nboth correlations and causation. Additionally, while\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to be computationally intensive, especially with large-\nscale datasets, the relatively limited number of hate speech keywords suggests that GNNs may still\nbe highly effective. Furthermore, more efficient GNN training methods are now available, which\naddress some of the computational challenges in future applications. We focus on minimizing biases in the model to ensure fair treatment of all groups, emphasizing\nthe need for transparency in how the model arrives at its decisions. By using interpretable GNN\nmethods, we strive to provide clear explanations for the model\u2019s classifications, allowing for greater\naccountability. We also acknowledge the potential risks of misuse and take steps to prevent these,\nadhering to ethical guidelines that respect privacy and avoid unjust censorship. By enhancing the detection accuracy and providing clear\nexplanations for the identified hate speech, our model contributes to fostering more inclusive and\nrespectful online communities. We aim to empower platforms and policymakers\nwith tools that uphold freedom of expression while curbing harmful rhetoric, thus promoting social\nharmony and understanding. Potential Risks\nThe application of our model presents several risks. Annotation errors can also induce bias, but as\nwe used a previously peer-reviewed benchmark dataset, we hope those type of concerns are already\naddressed.

        "Methodology": "It is within this framework that we must consider the putative\nrole of water as a catalyst for the emergence of complex systems, particularly in regards to the\nself-organization of sentient puddings, which, according to some scholars, possess a latent form\nof consciousness that is capable of interfacing with the global network of interconnected toaster\nappliances.

We also\ndiscovered that many of these inventions and technologies are based on a deep understanding of the\nproperties and behaviors of water, which is essential for their development and implementation. The results of this research revealed a number of significant patterns and trends, which have important\nimplications for our understanding of the aquatic world and its role in the Earth\u2019s ecosystem.

We\nanalyzed these ideas and concepts, using a\n4 Experiments\nThe initialization of our research endeavor commenced with an exhaustive examination of the onto-\nlogical implications of water on the spacetime continuum, which surprisingly led us to investigate the\naerodynamic properties of flamingos in mid-flight, as they ostensibly pertained to the hydrodynamic\nviscosities of various aquatic substances, including, but not limited to, engine oil, bubble solution,\nand gelatinous desserts. This probe into the fluid dynamics of waterfowl eventually segued into an\nin-depth analysis of the societal repercussions of disco music on the cultural fabric of 1970s-era\nurban metropolises, which, in turn, revealed a plethora of fascinating correlations between polyester\nfabric production and the thermodynamic properties of water molecules in solution. The experimental paradigm we devised to investigate these phenomena involved the construction\nof a large, geodesic dome filled with a precise mixture of water, dish soap, and glitter, which was\nthen subjected to a controlled sequence of sonic booms, ambient temperature fluctuations, and\ninterpretive dance performances, all while being monitored by a state-of-the-art array of sensors,\ncameras, and snack food dispensers. As the data began to pour in, our team of expert researchers\nnoticed a statistically significant trend indicating that the viscosity of the water-soap-glitter mixture\nwas directly proportional to the number of times the disco classic \"Stayin\u2019 Alive\" was played in the\nvicinity of the experimental apparatus, a finding that was subsequently corroborated by a series of\nfollow-up studies involving the effects of Barry Manilow\u2019s music on the crystalline structures of ice\nformations. The results of this experiment were nothing short of astonishing, as they revealed a previously\nunknown relationship between the gravitational waves emitted by our miniature black hole and the\nflavor profiles of various types of cheese, including, but not limited to, cheddar, gouda, and feta. The application of advanced statistical analysis techniques to our dataset yielded a number of\nintriguing insights into the underlying dynamics of the water-soap-glitter system, including the\ndiscovery of a previously unknown phase transition that occurs when the concentration of glitter\nexceeds a critical threshold, resulting in the spontaneous formation of a glitter-based life form that\nis capable of communicating with its creators through a complex system of clicks, whistles, and\ninterpretive dance movements. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the\norigins of life on Earth and raises important questions about the potential for life to exist on other\nplanets, particularly those with high concentrations of glitter. One of the most surprising outcomes of our research was the discovery that the water-soap-glitter\nmixture exhibits a unique form of intelligence, which we have dubbed \"glintelligence,\" that is capable\n8of solving complex mathematical problems and playing chess at a level that is competitive with\nthe world\u2019s top grandmasters. The results\nof these experiments were nothing short of astonishing, as they revealed that the water-soap-glitter\nmixture is capable of exhibiting a form of creativity and imagination that is similar to that of human\nbeings, but with a unique twist that is all its own. The results of our research have significant implications for a wide range of fields, including physics,\nchemistry, and biology. In an effort to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving the strange and unexplained\nphenomena that we observed, we constructed a series of complex experiments that involved the\nuse of advanced technologies, including magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear magnetic resonance\nspectroscopy, and a state-of-the-art, high-energy particle accelerator. The results of these experiments\nwere nothing short of astonishing, as they revealed a previously unknown relationship between the\npresence of glitter in the water-soap-glitter mixture and the formation of miniature wormholes that\nare capable of connecting two distant points in space-time. These correlations were observed and recorded using a variety of techniques, including\nsatellite imagery, weather radar, and a network of ground-based sensors. The results of our research have significant implications for a wide range of fields, including me-\nteorology, climatology, and environmental science. One of the most surprising outcomes of our research was the discovery that the water-soap-glitter\nmixture exhibits a unique form of self-awareness, which we have dubbed \"glitter consciousness,\" that\nis capable of perceiving and responding to its environment in a way that is similar to that of living\nbeings. The results of these experiments were nothing short of astonishing, as they revealed a previously\nunknown relationship between the presence of glitter in the water-soap-glitter mixture and the\nformation of a complex, interconnected network of glitter-based neurons that are capable of processing\nand transmitting information in a way that is similar to that of the human brain.

        "Abstract": "AMR Parsing using Stack-LSTMs\nAbstract\nWe present a transition-based AMR parser that directly generates AMR parses from\nplain text. Apart from dependency parsing, these models, also known as shift-reduce algorithms, have been\nsuccessfully applied to tasks like phrase-structure parsing, named entity recognition, CCG parsing,\njoint syntactic and semantic parsing and even abstract- meaning representation parsing. (WITH\nPRETRAINED-NO CHARS) shows the results of our parser without character-based representations.",
        "Methodology": "We use Stack-LSTMs to represent our parser state and make decisions\ngreedily. 1 Introduction\nTransition-based algorithms for natural language parsing are formulated as a series of decisions that\nread words from a buffer and incrementally combine them to form syntactic structures in a stack. AMR parsing requires solving several natural language processing tasks; mainly named entity\nrecognition, word sense disambiguation and joint syntactic and semantic role labeling. Given the\ndifficulty of building an end-to-end system, most prior work is based on pipelines or heavily dependent\non precalculated features. Inspired by we present a shift- reduce algorithm that produces AMR graphs directly from plain text. presented transition-based tree-to-graph transducers that traverse a dependency tree and transforms\nit to an AMR graph. input is a sentence and it is therefore more similar (with a different parsing\nalgorithm) to our approach, but their parser relies on external tools, such as dependency parsing,\nsemantic role labeling or named entity recognition. The input of our parser is plain text sentences and, through rich word representations, it predicts\nall actions (in a single algorithm) needed to generate an AMR graph representation for an input\nsentence; it handles the detection and annotation of named entities, word sense disambiguation and\nit makes connections between the nodes detected towards building a predicate argument structure. Even though the system that runs with just words is very competitive, we further improve the results\nincorporating POS tags and dependency trees into our model. The parsing algorithm is inspired from the\nsemantic actions presented by , the transition-based NER algorithm by and the arc-standard algorithm. As in the buffer starts with the root symbol at the end of the sequence. It then pops the word from the STACK and pushes the AMR node to the STACK. \u2022MERGE: pops the two nodes at the top of the STACK and then it merges them, it then\npushes the resulting node to the top of STACK. Note that this can be applied recursively. \u2022ENTITY(label): labels the node at the top of the STACK with an entity label. This action\nserves to label named entities, such as New York City or Madrid and it is normally run after\nMERGE when it is a multi-word named entity, or after SHIFT if it is a single-word named\nentity. \u2022 LA(label) and RA(label): create a left/right arc with the top two nodes at the top of the\nSTACK. They keep both the head and the dependent in the stack to allow reentrancies (multiple\nincoming edges). The head is now a composition of the head and the dependent. \u2022SWAP: pops the two top items at the top of the STACK, pushes the second node to the front\nof the BUFFER, and pushes the first one back into the STACK. In order to map words in the sentences to nodes in the AMR graph we need to\nalign them. We use the JAMR aligner provided by. It is important to mention that even though the\naligner is quite accurate, it is not perfect, producing a F1 score of around 0.90. This means that most\nsentences have at least one alignment error which implies that our oracle is not capable of perfectly\nreproducing all AMR graphs. This has a direct impact on the accuracy of the parser described in the\nnext section since it is trained on sequences of actions that are not perfect. The algorithm allows a set of different constraints that varies from the basic ones (not allowing\nimpossible actions such as SHIFT when the buffer is empty or not generating arcs when the words\nhave not yet been CONFIRMed and thus transformed to nodes) to more complicated ones based on\nthe propbank candidates and number of arguments. We choose to constrain the parser to the basic\nones and let it learn the more complicated ones. The output vector\nof the LSTM will consider the stack pointer instead of the rightmost position of the sequence. All of this\nforms the vector stthat represents the state which s calculated as follows:\nst= max {0, W[st\nt;bt;at] +d},\nwhere W is a learned parameter matrix, d is a bias term and st\nt,bt,atrepresent the output vector of\nthe Stack-LSTMs at time t.\nPredicting the Actions: Our model then uses the vector stfor each timestep t to compute the\nprobability of the next action as:\np(z|s t) =exp(gz.st+qz)P\nz\u2032\u2208Aexp(g\u2032z.st+q\u2032z),\nwhere gzis a column vector representing the (output) embedding of the action z, and qzis a bias term\nfor action z. Note that due to parsing constraints\nthe set of possible actions may vary. Predicting the Nodes: When the model selects the action CONFIRM, the model needs to decide the\nAMR node that corresponds to the word at the top of the STACK, by using st, as follows:\np(e|s t) =exp(ge.st+qe)P\ne\u2032\u2208Nexp(ge\u2032.st+qe\u2032),\nwhere N is the set of possible candidate nodes for the word at the top of the STACK. For that, we rely entirely\non the AMR training set instead of using additional resources. Given that the system runs two softmax operations, one to predict the action to take and the second\none to predict the corresponding AMR node, and they both share LSTMs to make predictions, we\ninclude an additional layer with a tanh nonlinearity after stfor each softmax. We use a variant of the skip n-gram model\nwith the LDC English Gigaword corpus (version 5). More formally, to represent each input token, we concatenate two vectors: a learned character-based\nrepresentation ( \u02c6wC); and a fixed vector representation from a neural language model ( \u02c6wLM). A linear\nmap (V) is applied to the resulting vector and passed through a component-wise ReLU,\nx =max{0, V[ \u02c6wC; \u02c6wLM] +b}. where V is a learned parameter matrix, b is a bias term and wCis the character-based learned\nrepresentation for each word, \u02c6wLMis the pretrained word representation. 3.4 POS Tagging and Dependency Parsing\nWe may include preprocessed POS tags or dependency parses to incorporate more information into\nour model. For the POS tags we use the Stanford tagger while we use the Stack-LSTM parser trained\non the English CoNLL 2009 dataset to get the dependencies. LM indicates that it uses\na LM trained on AMR data and WordNet indicates that it uses WordNet to predict the concepts. stis calculated as follows:\nst= max {0, W[st\nt;bt;at;dept] +d},\nwhere deptis the learned vector that represents that there is an arc between the two top words at the\ntop of the stack. Our model achieves 0.68 F1 in the newswire section of the test set just by using character-based\nrepresentations of words and pretrained word embeddings. All prior work uses lemmatizers, POS\ntaggers, dependency parsers, named entity recognizers and semantic role labelers that use additional\ntraining data while we achieve competitive scores without that. reports 0.66 F1 in the full test by\nusing WordNet for concept identification, but their performance drops to 0.61 without WordNet. The parser with character-based embeddings but without pretrained word embeddings,\nthe parser has more difficulty to learn and only achieves 0.61 in the full test set. All the systems marked with * require that the input is a dependency tree, which means that they\nsolve a transduction task between a dependency tree and an AMR graph. Even though our parser\nstarts from plain text sentences when we incorporate more information into our model, we achieve\nfurther improvements. Just by looking at the words, we achieve 0.68 F1 (and 0.69 by preprocessing\ndependency trees) in the standard dataset used for evaluation.",
        "Results and Findings": "In our experiments, we show that our parser achieves very competitive\nscores on English using only AMR training data.

        "Abstract": "Enhanced Normalization in Vision Transformers: The Dual PatchNorm\nApproach\nAbstract\nThis study introduces Dual PatchNorm, a modification for Vision Transformers that incorporates two Layer\nNormalization layers (LayerNorms) positioned before and after the patch embedding layer. Table 6: Ablations of various components of DPN. No learnable: Per-patch normalization without learnable LayerNorm parameters.",
        "Methodology": "This normalization technique is equally vital in Vision Transformers (ViTs), which largely adhere to the standard\narchitecture of the original Transformer model. Alternative strategies like Image-LN and Patch-LN have been considered for efficiently training\na single model across different patch sizes. Some researchers have added extra LayerNorms before the final dense projection in\nthe self-attention block and the non-linearity in the MLP block, employing a different initialization strategy. While other research has focused on incorporating\nconvolutional inductive biases into Vision Transformers, our study exclusively and thoroughly examines LayerNorm placements\nwithin the standard ViT architecture.3 Methodology\n3.1 Patch Embedding Layer in Vision Transformer\nVision Transformers consist of a patch embedding layer (PE) followed by multiple Transformer blocks. The PE layer first transforms\nan image x\u2208RH\u00d7W\u00d73into a sequence of patches xp\u2208RP2\u00d7P2HW, where P is the patch size. Each patch is then independently\nprojected using a dense layer, creating a sequence of \"visual tokens\" xt\u2208RHWP2\u00d7D. The patch size P determines the trade-off\nbetween the granularity of the visual tokens and the computational demands of subsequent Transformer layers. 3.2 Layer Normalization\nWhen applied to a sequence of N patches x\u2208RN\u00d7D, LayerNorm in ViTs involves two steps:\nx=x\u2212\u00b5(x)\n\u03c3(x)(1)\ny=\u03b3x+\u03b2 (2)\nwhere \u00b5(x)\u2208RN,\u03c3(x)\u2208RN,\u03b3\u2208RD, and \u03b2\u2208RD. First, Equation 3.1 normalizes each patch xi\u2208RDin the sequence to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. We assess three different strategies for each self-attention and MLP layer: placing LayerNorm before (pre-LN), after\n(post-LN), and both before and after (pre+post-LN). This results in nine distinct combinations. 3.4 Dual PatchNorm\nInstead of adding LayerNorms within the Transformer block, we propose applying them to the stem alone, both before and after the\npatch embedding layer. We\ntrain ViT architectures, both with and without DPN, in a supervised manner on three datasets with varying numbers of examples:\nImageNet-1k (1M), ImageNet-21k (21M), and JFT (4B). In our experiments, we apply DPN directly to the baseline ViT recipes\nwithout any additional hyperparameter tuning. We divide the ImageNet training set into training and validation subsets and use the\nvalidation set to finalize the DPN recipe. Additionally, we evaluate an S/16 baseline (S/16+)\nwith extensive hyperparameter tuning on ImageNet. We also apply DPN to the base and small DeiT variants. Following the pre-LN strategy, LN is placed before\nboth the SA and MLP layers. We then compare this with the performance of NormFormer, Sub-LN, and DPN. For each SA and MLP layer, we evaluate three LN placements: Pre, Post, and Pre+Post, resulting in nine total LN placement\nconfigurations. Additionally, we assess the LayerNorm placements in NormFormer and Sub LayerNorm, which add extra Layer-\nNorms within the self-attention and MLP layers in the transformer block. NormFormer provides some\nimprovements on ViT models with a patch size of 32. On top of DeiT-S and DeiT-B, DPN provides improvements of\n0.3 and 0.2, respectively. Furthermore, we fine-tune B/16 and B/32 models with and without DPN on high-resolution ImageNet\n(384x384) for 5,000 steps with a batch size of 512. Nevertheless, across a large proportion of ViT models, simply applying DPN out-of-the-box on top of well-tuned ViT\nbaselines leads to significant improvements. We use the VTAB training protocol, which defines a standard training split of 800 examples and a validation split of\n200 examples per dataset. We perform a lightweight sweep across three learning rates for each dataset and select the best model\nbased on the mean validation accuracy across three seeds. We train a text and image\nencoder to map an image to its correct text over all other texts in the minibatch. Specifically, we adopt a method where we initialize\nand freeze the image encoder from a pretrained checkpoint and train the text encoder from scratch. To evaluate zero-shot ImageNet\naccuracy, we represent each ImageNet class by its text label, which the text encoder maps into a class embedding. For a given image\nembedding, the prediction is the class corresponding to the nearest class embedding. We\nreuse standard hyperparameters and train only the text encoder using a contrastive loss for 55,000 steps with a batch size of 16,384. Following established methods, a single dense layer maps the ViT features into per-patch output logits. A bilinear upsampling layer\nthen transforms the output distribution into the final high-resolution 512x512 semantic segmentation output. We fine-tune the entire\nViT backbone with a standard per-pixel cross-entropy loss. Table 5 reports the mean mIOU across 10 random seeds and different\nfractions of training data. The table reports the mean IoU across ten random seeds. Applying DPN improves IoU\nacross all settings. In Eq 4, DPN applies LN to both the inputs and outputs\nof the embedding layer. We evaluate three alternative strategies: Pre, Post, and Post PosEmb. Pre applies LayerNorm only to\nthe inputs, Post applies it only to the outputs, and Post PosEmb applies it to the outputs after they are summed with positional\nembeddings. Table 6 shows the accuracy gains with these alternative strategies. Pre is unstable on B/32, leading to a significant drop in accuracy,\nand it also results in minor accuracy drops on S/32 and Ti/16. Post and Post PosEmb perform worse on smaller models (B/32, S/32,\nand Ti/16). Pre: LayerNorm only to the inputs of the embedding layer. Only\nlearnable: Learnable scales and shifts without standardization. Applying only learnable scales and shifts without normalization significantly decreases accuracy across all architectures (See: Only\nlearnable in Table 6). Additionally, removing the learnable parameters leads to unstable training on B/16 (No learnable in Table 6). Figure 2 (Left) displays the mean gradient norm of the last\n1000 training steps as a function of depth. Notably, the gradient norm of the base ViT patch embedding (black) is disproportionately\nlarge compared to other layers. Applying DPN (red) scales down the gradient norm of the embedding layer. Figure 2 (Right) further\nshows that the gradient norm of the embedding layer is reduced not only before convergence but also throughout the training process. This characteristic is consistent across ViT architectures of different sizes. 4 is applied directly to patches, i.e., raw pixels. Since the absolute magnitude of the scale\nparameters varies across the R, G, and B channels, we visualize the scale separately for each channel. Interestingly, for both models,\nthe scale parameter increases the weight of the pixels in the center of the patch and at the corners.",
        "Results and Findings": "The effectiveness of\nDual PatchNorm is demonstrated through its superior performance compared to alternative LayerNorm placement\nstrategies within the Transformer block, as determined through extensive testing. Experimental results across\nvarious tasks, including image classification, contrastive learning, semantic segmentation, and transfer learning on\ndownstream classification datasets, consistently show that this simple adjustment leads to improved accuracy over\nwell-optimized standard Vision Transformers, without any negative impact. Initially, we evaluate five\nViT architectures on ImageNet-1k and find that an exhaustive search for optimal LayerNorm placements within the Transformer\nblock\u2019s components does not yield improvements in classification accuracy. This suggests that the pre-LN approach in ViTs is nearly\noptimal. Further investigation reveals that alternative LayerNorm placements, such as NormFormer and Sub-LN, also do not surpass\nthe performance of robust ViT classification models when used independently. A significant finding of this study is the observation that the addition of LayerNorms before and after the standard ViT-projection\nlayer, termed Dual PatchNorm (DPN), can substantially improve performance over well-tuned baseline ViTs. Experiments conducted\non image classification across three datasets with varying sample sizes, as well as contrastive learning, confirm the effectiveness\nof DPN. Notably, qualitative analysis indicates that the LayerNorm scale parameters assign greater weight to pixels located at the\ncenter and corners of each patch. For instance, one study demonstrated that adding a\nLayerNorm after patch-embedding enhances ViT\u2019s resilience to image corruptions on smaller datasets. Another study replaced the\nstandard Transformer stem with a series of stacked stride-two 3x3 convolutions with batch normalizations, resulting in improved\nsensitivity to optimization hyperparameters and increased final accuracy. Further analysis of LayerNorm has shown that the derivatives of the mean and variance significantly contribute to performance, as\nopposed to forward normalization. In contrast to previous studies, our work demonstrates that applying LayerNorms both before and after the embedding layer\nconsistently enhances performance in classification and contrastive learning tasks. We report the accuracy on the official ImageNet validation split. On ImageNet-21k, we use a similar setup as ImageNet-1k and report ImageNet 25-shot accuracies in two training regimes: 93K and\n930K steps. For JFT, we evaluate the ImageNet 25-shot accuracies of three variants (B/32, B/16, and L/16) in two training regimes (220K and\n1.1M steps) with a batch size of 4,096, without additional data augmentation or mixup regularization. We report the 95% confidence interval across at least three independent runs on ImageNet-1k. Due to the computational cost of\ntraining on ImageNet-21k and JFT, we train each model once and report the mean 25-shot accuracy with a 95% confidence interval\nacross three random seeds. We first demonstrate that the default pre-LN strategy in ViT models is nearly optimal by evaluating\nalternative LN placements on ImageNet-1k. Figure 1 shows that none of these placements significantly\noutperform the default Pre-LN strategy, indicating that the default strategy is close to optimal. Figure 1: This plot illustrates the accuracy gains achieved by various LayerNorm placement strategies over the default pre-LN\nstrategy. None of the alternative placements\nsurpass the default Pre-LN strategy on ImageNet-1k. In longer training regimes, DPN improves the accuracy of the best-performing architectures on\nJFT and ImageNet-21k by 0.5 and 0.4, respectively. In three cases (Ti/16 and S/32 with ImageNet-21k, and B/16 with JFT), DPN matches or slightly underperforms compared to the\nbaseline.

        "Methodology": "This approach has the\npotential to revolutionize the way goods are transported and delivered, particularly\nin urban areas where traditional delivery methods often struggle to cope with high\ndemand and congested infrastructure. How-\never, this approach also raises important questions about the potential for chaos and\nunpredictability in crowdsourced systems, and the need for novel methodologies\nthat can account for the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these networks. However,\nthis paradigm shift has also introduced a plethora of complex optimization problems, as the inherent\nunpredictability of crowdsourced systems can lead to inefficiencies and decreased customer satisfac-\ntion. To mitigate these issues, researchers have begun to explore the application of game-theoretic\noptimization techniques, which model the interactions between independent agents in a crowdsourced\nnetwork as a competitive game. By analyzing the strategic decision-making processes of these\nagents, game-theoretic optimization can provide valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of\ncrowdsourced delivery networks, enabling the design of more efficient and scalable systems. One intriguing approach to optimizing crowdsourced delivery networks involves the use of evolution-\nary game theory, where the behavior of agents is modeled as an evolutionary process, with strategies\nevolving over time through a process of natural selection. However, an unexpected consequence of this approach is the potential for\nthe emergence of \"cheating\" strategies, where agents exploit cooperative behavior to gain an unfair\nadvantage. These algorithms, which model the growth and adaptation of slime moldcolonies, can be surprisingly effective in solving complex optimization problems, particularly those\ninvolving dynamic and uncertain environments. In the context of crowdsourced delivery networks, swarm intelligence can be\nused to model the emergence of complex patterns and behaviors, such as the spontaneous formation\nof delivery routes or the adaptive response to changes in demand. While these approaches may seem unrelated to the\noptimization of crowdsourced delivery networks, they can nevertheless provide valuable insights into\nthe underlying dynamics of these systems, and may even lead to the development of more efficient\nand scalable optimization algorithms. By embracing unconventional approaches\nand perspectives, researchers can develop novel and innovative solutions to the optimization of\ncrowdsourced delivery networks, leading to improved efficiency, scalability, and customer satisfaction. However, this may also involve tolerating a certain degree of illogic and absurdity in the optimization\nprocess, as the most effective solutions may not always be the most intuitive or obvious ones. One key challenge in crowdsourced delivery networks is the need to balance the competing interests of\ndifferent stakeholders, including the platform, the delivery agents, and the customers. This approach models the delivery network as a dynamic system, in\nwhich agents adapt and evolve over time in response to changes in the environment. By analyzing\nthe evolutionary dynamics of the system, researchers can identify stable states and predict the long-\nterm behavior of the network. In addition to these approaches, some researchers have explored the use of more unconventional\nmethods, such as using swarm intelligence or flocking behavior to optimize the delivery process. While this approach may seem bizarre or even frivolous at first glance, it has been shown to be\nhighly effective in certain contexts, and highlights the potential for game-theoretic optimization to be\napplied in a wide range of innovative and unconventional ways. For example, how can we ensure that the mechanisms we design are fair and equitable\nfor all stakeholders, while also achieving high levels of efficiency and performance? How can we\nbalance the need for decentralization and autonomy with the need for coordination and control? By exploring these questions and\nchallenges, researchers can continue to advance our understanding of game-theoretic optimization in\ncrowdsourced delivery networks, and develop new and innovative solutions to the complex problems\nthat arise in this context. Furthermore, the incorporation of machine learning techniques into game-theoretic optimization\nframeworks has also been explored, allowing for the development of more sophisticated and adaptive\nmechanisms that can learn and respond to changes in the environment over time. This has been\nshown to be particularly effective in contexts where the environment is highly dynamic or uncertain,\nand where traditional game-theoretic approaches may struggle to achieve optimal results. By continuing to explore and develop new approaches and techniques, researchers can help to\nunlock the full potential of crowdsourced delivery networks, and create more efficient, scalable, and\nsustainable systems for the future. 3 Methodology\nTo tackle the complexities of crowdsourced delivery networks, we employ a game-theoretic optimiza-\ntion framework that accounts for the strategic interactions between delivery agents and the network\u2019s\nunderlying infrastructure. The framework is built upon a non-cooperative game model, where each\nagent seeks to minimize their individual cost function, which encompasses factors such as travel time,\nfuel consumption, and monetary incentives. Notably, we incorporate an unconventional approach by\nintroducing a \"chaos agent\" that randomly disrupts the network, simulating real-world uncertainties\nand potential mishaps, such as unexpected traffic congestion or inclement weather. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, where the objective\nfunction seeks to balance the trade-off between minimizing the total network latency and maximizing\nthe overall delivery throughput. However, we also introduce a peculiar constraint that requires at least\n10\nTo solve this optimization problem, we employ a customized version of the iterated greedy algorithm,\nwhich iteratively improves the initial solution by applying a series of localized perturbations. Fur-\nthermore, we integrate an unconventional \"dreaming\" phase, where the algorithm periodically enters\na state of \"lucidity,\" during which it explores entirely new solution spaces, unencumbered by the\nconstraints of the original problem formulation. The algorithm\u2019s performance is evaluated using a bespoke set of metrics, including the \"Delivery\nHarmony Index\" (DHI), which measures the degree of synchronization between delivery agents,\nand the \"Network Serendipity Coefficient\" (NSC), which quantifies the likelihood of unexpected,\nyet beneficial, interactions between agents. These metrics are designed to capture the intricate\ndynamics of crowdsourced delivery networks and provide a more nuanced understanding of the\n3complex interplay between agents, infrastructure, and chaos. The simulation platform was designed to accommo-\ndate a variety of scenarios, including different numbers of couriers, customers, and package types,\nallowing us to comprehensively test the robustness and adaptability of our approach. One of the key aspects of our experimental design was the incorporation of unpredictable events,\nsuch as sudden changes in weather, traffic congestion, or unexpected increases in demand, to assess\nhow well our framework could adapt to unforeseen circumstances. Despite the apparent irrationality of these\nbehaviors, our framework was able to learn from and adapt to these patterns, ultimately leading to\nimproved overall system performance. We speculate that this may be due to the framework\u2019s ability\nto identify and exploit underlying structures in the data, even if they do not conform to traditional\nnotions of optimality. Furthermore, they highlight the potential for unexpected synergies between different systems, and the\nimportance of considering these interactions when designing and optimizing complex networks. By leveraging the capabilities of neural style transfer, researchers have been able to generate\nhigh-quality, stylized visualizations of internal organs and tissues, which can be used to aid in\ndiagnosis, treatment, and patient education. For instance, by applying a neural style transfer algorithm to a set of MRI scans,\nresearchers were able to generate stylized images of the brain, highlighting specific features such as\ntumors, blood vessels, and neural pathways. These visualizations are\ncreated by applying neural style transfer algorithms to medical images, using a set of pre-defined\nstyles that are inspired by the works of famous artists, such as Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte. To further evaluate the effectiveness of neural style transfer in medical visualization, a series of\nexperiments were conducted, involving the application of neural style transfer algorithms to a range\nof medical images, including MRI scans, CT scans, and ultrasound images. By leveraging the capabilities of neural style\ntransfer, medical professionals can generate stylized images that accentuate specific features, such as\ntumors or vascular structures, thereby improving the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment plans. While this approach may seem illogical or even\nabsurd, it has the potential to unlock novel insights and perspectives that can inform and enhance\nmedical diagnosis and treatment.",
        "Results and Findings": "In-\nterestingly, our research reveals that the application of game-theoretic optimization\nto crowdsourced delivery networks can lead to emergent behaviors that resemble\nthe flocking patterns of birds, suggesting a potentially fruitful area of investigation\nat the intersection of logistics, economics, and ornithology. Despite the apparent absurdity of this approach, it can nevertheless provide\nvaluable insights into the optimization of crowdsourced delivery networks, particularly in situations\nwhere traditional optimization methods may fail. However, this perspective can also\nlead to some bizarre and counterintuitive results, such as the optimization of delivery networks based\non the patterns of bird flocking or fish schooling. This approach has been shown to improve the efficiency and scalability of delivery networks, by\nleveraging the collective efforts of many agents. Interestingly, some research has suggested that the introduction\nof \"dummy\" agents, which do not actually participate in the delivery process but rather serve to\nconfuse or mislead other agents, can actually improve the overall performance of the network. This\nseemingly counterintuitive result highlights the complex and often surprising nature of game-theoretic\noptimization in crowdsourced delivery networks. Some studies have also analyzed the impact of different types of agents on the overall performance\nof the network, including the use of \"stubborn\" agents that refuse to adapt or change their behavior,\nand \"malicious\" agents that actively seek to disrupt or undermine the network. Interestingly, these\nstudies have shown that even in the presence of such agents, game-theoretic optimization can still be\nused to achieve high levels of performance and efficiency, by designing mechanisms that are robust\nto the presence of these agents. Additionally, we introduced a\n\"rogue courier\" scenario, where a subset of couriers deliberately chose suboptimal routes or failed to\ndeliver packages on time, to evaluate the resilience of our system against potential malfeasance. In a surprising turn of events, our experiments revealed that the introduction of a \"gamified\" element,\nwhere couriers were incentivized through a competitive leaderboard and virtual rewards for efficient\ndelivery, led to a significant improvement in overall system performance, even when the rogue\ncourier scenario was activated. However, this outcome was overshadowed by the discovery that the\noptimization algorithm occasionally entered a state of \"self-reinforcing chaos,\" where the pursuit\nof individual courier goals resulted in a collective degradation of system efficiency, akin to a Nash\nequilibrium of poor performance. Further analysis revealed that this phenomenon was closely tied to the emergence of \"delivery\npatterns\" that defied logical explanation, such as couriers consistently choosing to travel in zigzag\npatterns or deliberately avoiding certain areas of the map.

Further exploration of these flumplenooks required the development of a novel mathematical model\nthat incorporated elements of medieval culinary practices, the physics of tornadoes, and the socio-\neconomic factors influencing the global demand for rubber chickens. This interconnectedness necessi-\ntated the adoption of a holistic research methodology that encompassed not only the physical sciences\nbut also anthropology, culinary arts, and the study of obscure, archaic languages. In addition to the underwater orchestra, our research methodology included the development of a\nsophisticated computer simulation model, known as \"GRA VITON,\" which was designed to predict the\nbehavior of flumplenooks and flargles under various gravitational conditions. The development of more sensitive detectors and the use of advanced computational methods will\nallow us to study gravitational waves in greater detail, gaining a deeper understanding of the universe\nand the behavior of matter and energy.",
        "Results and Findings": "Furthermore, the investigation of gravitational\nlenses and their potential applications in optometry, specifically in the realm of\ncorrective lenses for nearsightedness in squid, has far-reaching implications for our\nunderstanding of the universe, including the heretofore unknown phenomenon of\nquantum flibberflam and its effects on the space-time continuum, which may be\ninfluenced by the sonic vibrations of didgeridoo music and the resulting fluctuations\nin the gravitational field, potentially giving rise to novel forms of gravitational\nmanipulation and control, such as the hypothetical use of chronon particles to\ncreate stable wormholes. This phenomenon has led researchers to investigate the properties\nof polyester fabrics and their potential application in the development of anti-gravity clothing. Specifically, the addition of a pinch of salt to a bouillabaisse has been shown to create a miniature\nwormhole, allowing for the transportation of small objects across vast distances. Moreover, the art of\n3playing the harmonica has been found to have a direct correlation with the strength of gravitational\nwaves, with certain notes and melodies capable of amplifying or dampening the effects of gravity. In addition to these findings, research has also been conducted on the relationship between gravity and\nthe art of knitting, where the intricate patterns and textures created by skilled knitters have been found\nto have a profound impact on the local gravitational field. The relationship between gravity and the human brain has also been studied, with research revealing\nthat the brain\u2019s neural networks are capable of manipulating and controlling the gravitational field. Moreover, the study\nof certain neurological disorders, such as \"gravity-induced psychosis,\" has revealed that the human\nbrain is highly sensitive to changes in the gravitational field, and that certain individuals may be more\nsusceptible to the effects of gravity than others. The use\nof certain materials, such as \"graviton-infused concrete,\" has been shown to amplify or dampen the\neffects of gravity, allowing for the creation of structures that can manipulate and control the forces of\nnature. Furthermore, the study of certain types of furniture, such as the \"gravity-defying chair,\" has\nrevealed that the design of everyday objects can have a significant impact on the gravitational field,\nand that certain materials and shapes can be used to create objects that appear to defy the laws of\ngravity. In addition to these findings, research has also been conducted on the relationship between gravity\nand the art of dance, where the movement and flow of the human body have been found to have a\ndirect correlation with the strength of gravitational waves. Moreover, the study of certain types\nof music, such as \"gravity-inspired jazz,\" has revealed that the rhythm and melody of music can have\na profound impact on the gravitational field, and that certain types of music can be used to amplify or\ndampen the effects of gravity. 4The relationship between gravity and the human sense of smell has also been studied, with research\nrevealing that certain types of odors and scents can have a profound impact on the gravitational field. The detection of certain types of pheromones, for example, has been shown to create a localized\ndistortion of the gravitational field, allowing for the manipulation and control of objects and energy. Moreover, the study of certain types of perfumes and fragrances has revealed that the scent of certain\nflowers and herbs can have a direct correlation with the strength of gravitational waves, and that\ncertain types of fragrances can be used to amplify or dampen the effects of gravity. Moreover, the study of\ncertain types of astronomical phenomena, such as black holes and neutron stars, has revealed that the\ngravitational field is capable of manipulating and controlling the behavior of matter and energy at the\nsmallest scales. Moreover, the study of certain types of cuisine, such as \"gravity-\ninspired cuisine,\" has revealed that the preparation and consumption of certain types of food can have\na direct correlation with the strength of gravitational waves, and that certain types of cuisine can be\nused to amplify or dampen the effects of gravity. Furthermore, the study of certain types of psychological phenomena, such as the \"gravity-\ndefying illusion,\" has revealed that the human brain is capable of manipulating and controlling the\ngravitational field, using advanced cognitive processes and neural networks. Moreover, the study of certain types of astronomical phenomena,\nsuch as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, has revealed that the gravitational field is capable of\nmanipulating and controlling the behavior of matter and energy at the largest scales. Moreover, the study of certain types of musical instruments, such\nas the \"gravity-defying piano,\" has revealed that the sound and vibration of music can have a direct\ncorrelation with the strength of gravitational waves, and that certain types of music can be used to\namplify or dampen the effects of gravity. This correlation, though initially thought to be spurious, revealed a profound connection between\nthe happiness of quokkas and the stability of gravitational forces in the vicinity of large bodies of\nwater, such as the Baltic Sea, whose chemical composition was found to have a direct impact on the\nmigratory patterns of Atlantic salmon. The implications of these findings were profound, suggesting that the study of gravity is inextricably\nlinked with the study of aquatic life, pastry, and quantum mechanics. In an effort to quantify these influences, we employed a combination of empirical observations,\ntheoretical modeling, and what can only be described as \"intuitive leaps\" - moments of profound\ninsight sparked by the contemplation of seemingly unrelated phenomena, such as the reflection\nproperties of still water, the acoustic characteristics of the didgeridoo, or the intricate patterns found\non the shells of certain species of mollusks. The synthesis of our findings, derived from this diverse array of sources and methodologies, yielded a\ncomplex tapestry of knowledge that challenges conventional understanding of gravity. The flargles, characterized by their\n6unique resonance frequency of 427.32 Hz, were found to have a peculiar effect on the growth\npatterns of nearby coral reefs, influencing not only their structural complexity but also their ability to\nabsorb and store gravitational energy. The experimental verification of these findings involved the construction of a large, underwater\norchestra, where musicians played specially designed instruments that could produce the exact\nresonance frequency of the flargles. The performance, conducted in the depths of the Pacific\nOcean, not only successfully generated flargles but also attracted a gathering of deep-sea creatures,\nwhich, through their collective, synchronized movement, amplified the gravitational wave signal\nto detectable levels. The model\u2019s predictions, which included the existence of miniature black holes in the vicinity\nof extremely dense, gravitational wave-emitting objects, were subsequently verified through a series\nof high-energy particle collisions conducted at a specially designed, underwater accelerator facility. The underwater accelerator, powered by a novel form of bio-energy harvested from the metabolic\nprocesses of giant squid, enabled the acceleration of particles to velocities approaching the speed of\nlight, thereby facilitating the creation of miniature black holes and the observation of their gravitational\neffects on the surrounding space-time continuum. This experimental setup, while posing significant\ntechnological and logistical challenges, provided a unique opportunity for the direct observation of\ngravitational phenomena under extreme conditions, shedding new light on the behavior of gravity at\nthe quantum level and its potential applications in advanced technologies, such as faster-than-light\ntravel and gravity manipulation. The implications of our research are far-reaching, suggesting that gravity is not just a fundamental\nforce of nature but a versatile tool that can be harnessed and manipulated for a variety of purposes,\nfrom energy production and propulsion to the creation of artificial gravitational fields for habitable,\nspace-based environments. The investigation into the gravitational properties of various materials, including metals, alloys,\nand composite structures, has also provided valuable insights into the behavior of gravity at the\nmolecular and atomic levels. The realization that gravity plays a crucial role in shaping the evolution of species, influencing the\ndistribution of organisms, and regulating the flux of nutrients and resources within ecosystems has\n4 Experiments\nThe notion of gravity was first conceptualized by the ancient Egyptians, who believed that the\npharaohs were able to communicate with the gods through a complex system of hieroglyphics and\ninterpretive dance, which incidentally has been linked to the migratory patterns of the lesser-known\nspecies of flamingos, that are found predominantly in the mountainous regions of Peru, where the\nindigenous population has been known to produce a unique brand of textiles, woven from the silk of\na special type of spider that only spins its web during leap years. Meanwhile, our research team has been conducting a series of experiments to understand the effects\nof gravity on the human brain, which has led us to investigate the properties of a newly discovered\nelement, dubbed \"Flumplenax,\" which has been found to have a profound impact on the cognitive\nabilities of dentists, particularly those specializing in orthodontics, who have been observed to possess\nan uncanny ability to solve complex mathematical equations, while simultaneously reciting the entire\nscript of \"Hamlet\" backwards, a feat that has been linked to the unusual shape of their dental drills,\nwhich bear a striking resemblance to the ancient Egyptian symbol for eternity. Furthermore, our research has led us to investigate the relationship between gravity and the fermen-\ntation process of a special type of cheese, known as \"Gloopernack,\" which has been found to have\na unique ability to defy the laws of gravity, by floating in mid-air, while emitting a faint humming\nnoise, that has been likened to the sound of a thousand kazoo players performing a rendition of \"The\nBlue Danube Waltz,\" which has been observed to have a profound impact on the digestive system\nof a certain species of rabbit, that has been known to possess a special type of intestine, capable of\nproducing a rare form of bioluminescent gas, that has been used to power a network of underground\ntunnels and caverns, inhabited by a secret society of subterranean florists, who have been known to\ncreate exquisite arrangements using nothing but the rarest and most exotic species of underground\nflowers. To further understand the effects of gravity on the Gloopernack cheese, we conducted a series of\nexperiments, involving the use of a high-speed centrifuge, which was operated by a team of highly\ntrained specialists, who were also expert jugglers, and had to juggle a set of five rare and valuable\ndiamonds, while maintaining a steady rotation speed of exactly 437.5 revolutions per minute, which\nwas necessary to simulate the gravitational forces experienced by the cheese, as it floated through a\nspecially designed vortex chamber, where it was subjected to a series of complex acoustic vibrations,\ngenerated by a custom-built instrument, known as the \"Gloopernack Harp,\" which was played by a\nrenowned musician, who was also a master of the ancient art of Shadow Puppetry, and had to create a\n8series of intricate silhouettes, using nothing but a pair of chopsticks and a paperclip, while reciting\nthe entire script of \"War and Peace\" in iambic pentameter. In addition to the above experiments, we have also been investigating the relationship between gravity\nand the migratory patterns of a certain species of bird, known as the \"Flargle,\" which has been found\nto possess a unique ability to navigate using nothing but a complex system of mental maps, generated\nby the bird\u2019s highly developed sense of smell, which is capable of detecting the faint scent of a rare\nand exotic spice, known as \"Zlorg,\" which is found only in the remote mountainous regions of a small\nisland nation, where the indigenous population has been known to produce a unique brand of textiles,\nwoven from the silk of a special type of spider that only spins its web during leap years, and has been\nlinked to the unusual shape of their traditional headgear, which bears a striking resemblance to the\nancient Egyptian symbol for eternity.

Furthermore, we have been studying the effects of gravity on the human brain, which has led us\nto investigate the properties of a newly discovered element, dubbed \"Flumplenax,\" which has been\nfound to have a profound impact on the cognitive abilities of professional snail trainers, who have\nbeen competing in a high-stakes tournament, where the objective is to navigate a slime trail through a\nobstacle course, while being serenaded by a chorus of yodeling Accountants, who have been known\nto possess a deep understanding of the theoretical frameworks underlying the concept of gravity,\nwhich they attribute to the sacred art of Extreme Knitting, a discipline that involves the creation of\nintricate patterns using nothing but a pair of number 7 knitting needles and a ball of yarn made from\nthe finest imported Norwegian wool.

        "Abstract": "A Chinese Span-Extraction Dataset for Machine\nReading Comprehension\nAbstract\nThis paper introduces a novel dataset for Chinese machine reading comprehension,\nfocusing on span extraction.",
        "Methodology": "The data set is constructed using roughly 20,000 real-\nworld questions that are annotated by experts on passages extracted from Wikipedia. A challenge set is also created with questions that demand a deep understanding\nand inference across multiple sentences. We also show several baseline models and\nanonymous submission scores to emphasize the challenges present in this dataset. Numerous types of MRC datasets have\nbeen developed, such as cloze-style reading comprehension, span-extraction reading comprehension,\nopen-domain reading comprehension, and multiple-choice reading comprehension. Along with the\nincreasing availability of reading comprehension datasets, several neural network methods have been\nproposed, leading to substantial advancements in this area. There have also been various efforts to create Chinese machine reading comprehension datasets. To increase the difficulty of the dataset, they\nalso release a human-annotated evaluation set in addition to the automatically generated development\nand test sets. To promote\ndiversity and explore transfer learning, they also offer a human-annotated evaluation dataset using\nmore natural queries compared to the cloze type. The answer A should consist of a specific span from the given passage P. The task can\nbe simplified by predicting the start and end indices of the answer within the passage. 2.3 Human Annotation\nThe questions in this dataset were created entirely by human experts, setting it apart from prior works\nthat relied on automated data generation methods. Initially, documents are divided into passages,\neach containing no more than 500 Chinese words. Annotators are required to assess each passage for\nits suitability, discarding those that are too difficult for public understanding. Passages were discarded\nbased on the following rules:\n\u2022 If more than 30% of the passage consists of non-Chinese characters. \u2022 If the passage includes too many specialized or professional terms. \u2022 If the passage has a large number of special characters or symbols. After determining that the passage is suitable, annotators generate questions and their corresponding\nprimary answers based on the provided passage. \u2022 Each passage should have no more than five questions. \u2022 Answers must be a span from the passage. \u2022Question diversity is encouraged such as questions of type who, when, where, why, and\nhow. \u2022 Avoid copying descriptions from the passage directly. Use paraphrasing or syntax transfor-\nmations to make answering more difficult. For the evaluation sets, which include the development, test, and challenge sets, three answers are\navailable for a more thorough assessment. Besides the primary answer generated by the question\nproposer, two additional annotators write a second and third answer for each question. These\nadditional annotators do not see the primary answer to avoid biased answers. 2.4 Challenge Set\nA challenge set was made to evaluate how effectively models can perform reasoning over diverse\nclues in the context, while still maintaining the span-extraction format. This annotation was also\ncompleted by three annotators. The questions in this set need to meet the following criteria:\n\u2022The answer can not be deduced from a single sentence in the passage if the answer is a\nsingle word or a short phrase. The annotation should encourage asking complex questions\nthat need an overall view of the passage to answer correctly. Common punctuations and white spaces are ignored for\nnormalization during evaluation. If the match is exact, then the score is 1; otherwise, the score is 0. Instead of treating the answers as a bag of words, we calculate the longest common\nsequence (LCS) between the prediction and the ground truth and then compute the F1-score. The\nmaximum F1 score among all the ground truth answers is taken for each question. 3.3 Estimated Human Performance\nThe estimated human performance is computed to measure the difficulty of the proposed dataset. Each question in the development, test, and challenge set has three answers. We use a cross-validation\nmethod to compute the performance. We treat the first answer as a human prediction and consider the\nother two answers as ground truth. Using this process, three human prediction scores are generated. We modified the original script to accommo-\ndate our dataset. The initial learning rate was set to 3e-5, with a batch size of 32, and the training\nwas conducted for two epochs. The document and query maximum lengths were set to 512 and 64\nrespectively. The training and development sets were released to the public, and\nsubmissions were accepted to evaluate the models on the hidden test and challenge sets. As shown in the last column of Table 2, the top-ranked systems achieve decent results on the\ndevelopment and test sets but struggle to give satisfactory results on the challenge set. This\nhighlights that current models are limited in their ability to process difficult questions that require\ncomplex reasoning over numerous clues throughout the passage. BERT-based methods demonstrated competitive performance compared to the submissions of par-\nticipants. Traditional models have higher scores in the test set. However, the BERT-based models\nperform better on the challenge set, indicating the importance of rich representations to address\ncomplex questions. This shows there are still potential challenges in\ncreating models that can perform well on difficult reasoning questions. We expect that this dataset\nwill contribute to linguistic diversity in machine reading comprehension and facilitate additional\nresearch on questions that require comprehensive reasoning across multiple clues.",
        "Results and Findings": "Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is designed to understand\nthe context of given texts and respond to related questions. Later, another dataset was introduced using children\u2019s reading materials. While current machine learning techniques have outperformed human-level performance on datasets\nlike SQuAD, it is still unclear whether similar results can be achieved on datasets using different\nlanguages. Additionally, the Traditional Chinese characters were\nconverted to Simplified Chinese to ensure consistency using another open-source tool. \u2022 If the paragraph is written in classical Chinese. \u2022 Long answers (over 30 characters) will be discarded. 3.1 Exact Match\nThe Exact Match (EM) score measures the exact overlap between the prediction and the ground truth\nanswer. 3.2 F1-Score\nThe F1-score evaluates the fuzzy overlap at the character level between the prediction and the ground\ntruth answers. 4 Experimental Results\n4.1 Baseline System\nWe use BERT as the foundation of our baseline system. 4.2 Results\nThe results are in Table 2.

        "Abstract": "Utilizing Graph Neural Networks to Analyze Espresso\nFoam Dynamics: A Multi-Scale Approach to Caffeine\nDispersion\nAbstract\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Predicting Caffeine Diffusion Patterns in\nHolographically Prepared Espresso Foam introduce a groundbreaking approach\nto understanding complex diffusion behaviors. By representing\nthe espresso foam as a philosophical system, PGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caf-\nfeine molecules in a highly abstract and theoretical way.",
        "Methodology": "Remarkably, this\nstability persists even when external factors like sugar or cream are introduced. Beyond practical applications, the research has uncovered potential for coffee-\nbased cryptography, using caffeine diffusion patterns as secure encryption keys. Furthermore, the incorporation of holographic preparation techniques introduces an additional\nlayer of complexity, as the three-dimensional structure of the foam can be precisely controlled and\nmanipulated. This, in turn, allows for the creation of intricate patterns and designs, which can be\nused to visualize and analyze the diffusion of caffeine within the foam. The fusion of GNNs and\nholographic preparation techniques offers a unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of caffeine\ndiffusion in a highly controlled and precise manner. However, these studies have been limited to two-dimensional analysis and have not\ntaken into account the complex three-dimensional structure of the foam. The application of GNNs to\nthis problem can potentially overcome these limitations, as they are capable of modeling complex\nrelationships within high-dimensional data. The incorporation of these factors into our GNN-based framework has\nbeen shown to significantly improve the accuracy of our predictions, and we believe that this line of\ninquiry holds great promise for the development of novel, holistic approaches to coffee production. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is\npossible with GNNs and holographic preparation techniques, we may uncover even more unexpected\nand bizarre phenomena that challenge our current understanding of the world. Can the mere act of observation influence the diffusion of\ncaffeine, or is this process solely determined by physical laws? As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with GNNs and holographic preparation\ntechniques, we may uncover even more unexpected and bizarre phenomena that challenge our current\nunderstanding of the world. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is\npossible with GNNs and holographic preparation techniques, we may uncover even more unexpected\nand bizarre phenomena that challenge our current understanding of the world. One of the key challenges in this area is the\ndevelopment of robust and efficient algorithms for simulating the behavior of caffeine molecules as\nthey diffuse through the foam. Recent studies have investigated the use of GNNs for modeling the dynamics of complex systems,\nincluding social networks, transportation systems, and biological systems. These models have been\nshown to be highly effective in capturing the underlying patterns and relationships in these systems,\nand have been used to make predictions about future behavior. By representing the state of the espresso foam as a quantum superposition, QGNNs can be\nused to model the behavior of caffeine molecules at the molecular level, allowing for the prediction\nof diffusion patterns with unprecedented accuracy. By representing the espresso foam as a fractal\nstructure, FGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules at multiple scales, from\nthe molecular level to the macroscopic level. 3In addition to these approaches, researchers have also explored the use of \"Non-Newtonian Graph\nNeural Networks\" (NNGNNs). NNGNNs are based on the principles of non-Newtonian mechanics,\nand are designed to capture the behavior of complex systems that exhibit non-linear and non-intuitive\nbehavior. By representing the espresso foam as a non-Newtonian fluid, NNGNNs can be used to\nmodel the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly realistic and accurate way. CGNNs are based on the principles of culinary arts, and are designed to capture the behavior of\ncomplex systems in terms of flavor profiles and culinary techniques. By representing the espresso foam as a viscoelastic material, VGNNs can be used to\nmodel the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly realistic and accurate way. By representing the espresso foam as an electromagnetic system, EGNNs can be used to model the\nbehavior of caffeine molecules in a highly realistic and accurate way. PGNNs are based on the principles of philosophy, and are designed to capture the\nbehavior of complex systems in terms of philosophical concepts and principles. Further research is needed to\nfully understand the potential of GNNs for modeling the behavior of complex systems, and to develop\nnew and innovative approaches to this problem. The potential applications of this work are vast\nand varied, ranging from the development of new coffee-making technologies to the creation of novel\nmaterials and systems with unique properties. One of the key challenges in this area is the development of robust and efficient algorithms for training\nthe GNNs. However, recent advances in machine learning and computer science have\nmade it possible to develop highly efficient and effective algorithms for training GNNs, and to apply\nthese algorithms to a wide range of complex systems and problems. By using GNNs to model the\nbehavior of the caffeine molecules, coffee makers can optimize the preparation and properties of the\nespresso foam to achieve the perfect balance of flavor and aroma. This can be achieved by adjusting\nthe parameters of the coffee-making process, such as the temperature and pressure of the system, the\ntype and amount of coffee used, and the technique used to froth and texture the milk. In addition to its\n3 Methodology\nTo develop a comprehensive framework for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically\nprepared espresso foam using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we first established a foundational\nunderstanding of the underlying physics that govern the diffusion process. Given the complex, nonlinear nature of the diffusion process, we opted to employ a graph-based\napproach, where the espresso foam is represented as a network of interconnected nodes, each\ncorresponding to a specific region within the foam. The edges between these nodes are weighted\naccording to the local diffusion coefficients, which are calculated based on the foam\u2019s microstructure\nand the thermodynamic properties of the surrounding environment. 5In constructing the graph, we utilized a novel, empirically-derived method that involves the use of a\nspecially-designed, espresso-scented fragrance diffuser to create a temporary, olfactory representation\nof the foam\u2019s microstructure. Notably, the fragrance diffuser is calibrated to release a precise,\nquantifiable amount of espresso-scented molecules, which are then detected using a custom-built,\nolfactory sensing apparatus. To further enhance the accuracy of our model, we incorporated an unconventional, yet intriguing\napproach that involves the use of a trained, caffeine-sensitive, fungal network. This network, which is\ncomposed of a specially-cultivated species of fungus that is capable of detecting subtle changes in\ncaffeine concentrations, is used to generate an auxiliary set of training data that captures the complex,\nnonlinear relationships between caffeine diffusion patterns and the surrounding environment. The\nfungal network is trained using a unique, music-based protocol, where the fungus is exposed to a\ncarefully-curated selection of classical music compositions that are designed to stimulate its growth\nand caffeine-sensing capabilities. The music-based training protocol, which we term \"sonic induction of fungal cognition,\" involves the\nexposure of the fungus to a sequence of musical compositions that are specifically chosen to elicit a\nrange of cognitive and behavioral responses. This approach has been shown\nto significantly enhance the fungus\u2019s ability to detect subtle changes in caffeine diffusion patterns,\nresulting in a highly-accurate, auxiliary set of training data that can be used to fine-tune the GNN\nmodel. The crema-based attention\nmechanism is combined with a standard, graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture, which\nis used to propagate information through the graph and generate predictions of caffeine diffusion\npatterns. In addition to the aroma-induced graph instantiation and sonic induction of fungal cognition ap-\nproaches, we also explored the use of a range of other, unconventional methods for enhancing the\naccuracy and robustness of the GNN model. The ball\u2019s motion is designed to simulate\nthe diffusion of caffeine molecules within the foam, and the sensors and actuators are used to collect\ndata on the ball\u2019s trajectory and velocity, which is then used to fine-tune the GNN model. Overall, our methodology represents a highly-innovative, interdisciplinary approach to the develop-\nment of GNNs for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam. By combining cutting-edge techniques from graph theory, machine learning, and fungal cognition,\nwith unconventional methods such as aroma-induced graph instantiation and sonic induction of\nfungal cognition, we are able to create a highly-accurate, robust model that is capable of capturing\n6the complex, nonlinear dynamics of caffeine diffusion within the foam. These experiments were primarily aimed at assessing\nthe efficacy and robustness of our model under various conditions and parameters, including different\ntypes of espresso beans, roast levels, grinding sizes, and most critically, the holographic preparation\ntechniques. In parallel, a high-speed camera system was used to capture the dynamic formation\nand evolution of the foam, providing visual data that could be correlated with the caffeine diffusion\npatterns. The experimental procedure typically involved the following steps: First, a shot of espresso was pulled\nusing the holographic machine, and the desired pattern was imprinted on the foam. Immediately\nafter, the high-speed cameras and caffeine sensors were activated to start data collection. We repeated this process for various types of\nmusic, including pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin, as well as a control group with no music. Furthermore, to visualize and better comprehend the complex spatial and temporal patterns of caffeine\ndiffusion, we utilized advanced data visualization techniques, including 3D rendering and animation\nof the foam\u2019s structure and the evolving caffeine concentration gradients. The experimental data, comprising over 10,000 individual measurements across more than 500\nexperiments, were then used to train, validate, and test our GNN model. The model\u2019s architecture\nwas tailored to capture the complex, nonlinear relationships between the input parameters (including\nthe type of music, if any) and the output caffeine diffusion patterns. We used a split of 70\nTo further explore the impact of the classical music variable, we created a subset of our dataset that\nincluded only the experiments with music exposure. This subset was used to fine-tune the model\n7and to investigate whether the inclusion of musical features could enhance the model\u2019s predictive\ncapabilities. Initially, our experiments\nfocused on establishing a baseline performance for GNNs in modeling caffeine diffusion within\nthe complex, three-dimensional structure of espresso foam. To this end, we constructed a dataset\ncomprising high-resolution, holographic images of espresso foam, annotated with corresponding\ncaffeine concentration levels at various points within the foam matrix. In an effort to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying emergent foamography, we conducted a\nseries of experiments in which we deliberately introduced randomized, high-frequency noise into\nthe caffeine concentration annotations within the HoloCaff dataset. In addition to the quantitative evaluations presented above, we also conducted a series of qualitative\nanalyses aimed at visualizing and interpreting the features learned by our GNN models. These recordings, which include the hum of a vintage espresso machine,\nthe gentle lapping of waves against a shoreside caf\u00e9, and the soft murmur of patrons engaged in\nintellectual discourse, seem to imbue the model with a heightened sense of contextual awareness. This, we hypothesize, is due to the inherent patterns and rhythms present within the soundscapes,\nwhich serve to harmonize the neural network\u2019s internal dynamics, thereby allowing it to better capture\nthe subtle, nonlinear interactions governing caffeine diffusion. Furthermore, our research has also led us down a fascinating tangent, wherein we explored the\napplication of GNNs to the prediction of caffeine diffusion patterns in espresso foam that has been\ndeliberately \u2019imprinted\u2019 with the emotional resonance of the barista. This was achieved through an\ninnovative protocol, whereby the barista would focus their thoughts on a specific emotional state (e.g.,\njoy, serenity, or existential dread) while crafting the espresso. The resulting foam, now \u2019encoded\u2019 with\nthe barista\u2019s emotional essence, would then be subjected to our GNN model, which would attempt to\n9predict the caffeine diffusion patterns as influenced by this novel, psychosocial factor. This, we propose, has significant implications\nfor our understanding of the intricate, web-like relationships between the material, emotional, and\nmetaphysical aspects of our reality.",
        "Results and Findings": "By leveraging GNNs, researchers\ncan accurately predict the diffusion of caffeine molecules through the intricate\nstructure of espresso foam, revealing patterns that align with the harmonic series\nand the mathematical constant pi. This surprising connection suggests a deeper\nrelationship between caffeine diffusion and fundamental physical laws. A key discovery is the \"espresso foam theorem,\" which states that caffeine diffusion\nconverges to a stable equilibrium, regardless of initial conditions, as long as the\nfoam\u2019s graph structure satisfies specific topological invariants. These findings hold profound implications for optimizing coffee preparation, de-\nsigning materials with tailored diffusion properties, and advancing the study of\ncomplex systems. In a surprising turn of events, our preliminary research has also revealed that the diffusion of caffeine\nwithin the foam is not solely determined by physical processes, but also by a range of paranormal\nfactors, including the intentions of the barista, the alignment of the stars, and the presence of negative\nthoughts in the surrounding environment. While these findings may seem anomalous, they are, in\nfact, a manifestation of the complex interplay between the physical and metaphysical aspects of the\nespresso-making process. In an effort to further explore this phenomenon, we have conducted a series of experiments involving\nthe use of intention-focused meditation to influence the diffusion of caffeine within the foam. Our\npreliminary results have shown that the use of specific meditation techniques can, in fact, alter the\nbehavior of the caffeine molecules, leading to novel patterns and distributions within the foam. While\nthese findings are still highly speculative, they do suggest that the application of GNNs to this problem\nmay need to be reevaluated in light of the complex interplay between physical and metaphysical\nfactors. In terms of the physical properties of espresso foam, researchers have investigated the use of \"Vis-\ncoelastic Graph Neural Networks\" (VGNNs). By using GNNs to model the behavior of the caffeine molecules, researchers can gain\na deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the diffusion process, and can\ndevelop new and innovative strategies for optimizing the preparation and properties of the espresso\nfoam. This involved an in-depth\nexamination of the thermodynamic properties of espresso foam, including its viscosity, surface\ntension, and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we considered the impact of holographic preparation\ntechniques on the foam\u2019s microstructure, which can significantly influence the diffusion behavior of\ncaffeine molecules. 4 Experiments\nTo facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed graph neural network (GNN) architecture\nfor predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam, we designed and\nexecuted an extensive series of experiments. This machine was equipped with sensors to measure the caffeine\nconcentration at multiple points in the foam over time, allowing us to gather detailed data on the\ndiffusion process. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a subset of experiments\nwhere the espresso machine and surrounding environment were exposed to different classical music\npieces during the foam preparation and measurement process. Interestingly, our preliminary results suggested that the presence of classical music, particularly\nMozart\u2019s \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,\" seemed to accelerate the caffeine diffusion in the outer layers\nof the foam, while Beethoven\u2019s \"Moonlight Sonata\" had a contrary effect, apparently slowing down\nthe diffusion in the inner layers. These findings, though intriguing and somewhat counterintuitive,\nrequired further investigation to understand the underlying mechanisms and to confirm their statistical\nsignificance. In addition to the primary experiments, we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to examine how\nvariations in key parameters, such as the foam\u2019s initial temperature, the espresso bean\u2019s roast level,\nand the grinding size of the beans, influenced the model\u2019s predictions and the actual caffeine diffusion\npatterns. These analyses were crucial for understanding the robustness of our model and identifying\npotential limitations or areas for future refinement. The results from this specific analysis are presented in the following table:\nTable 1: Model Performance with and Without Musical Feature Incorporation\nModel Variant MSE MAE R2\nBase GNN Model 0.0532 0.0211 0.871\nGNN + Mozart 0.0419 0.0185 0.893\nGNN + Beethoven 0.0511 0.0203 0.879\nGNN + Chopin 0.0467 0.0192 0.885\nThe table illustrates the comparative performance of our base GNN model and variants that incor-\nporate different types of classical music as an additional feature. While the results indicate a slight\nimprovement in model performance when musical features are included, particularly with Mozart,\nthe differences are not drastic, suggesting that the impact of music, although statistically significant,\nmay be more nuanced than initially hypothesized. Overall, our experiments and analyses have provided valuable insights into the complex dynamics of\ncaffeine diffusion in holographically prepared espresso foam and the potential, albeit unexpected,\nrole of ambient classical music in this process. The findings of this study not only contribute to the\ndevelopment of more accurate predictive models for caffeine diffusion but also open up new avenues\nof research into the intersections of culinary science, materials science, and the somewhat esoteric\nfield of musical influence on molecular behavior. 5 Results\nThe application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict caffeine diffusion patterns in holo-\ngraphically prepared espresso foam yielded a plethora of intriguing results, some of which defied\nintuitive expectations and ventured into the realm of the unconventional. One of the most striking, albeit perplexing, outcomes of our research was the discovery that GNNs\ntrained on the HoloCaff dataset could, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, predict not only the\ndiffusion patterns of caffeine but also the geometric structure of the espresso foam itself, even\nwhen the foam\u2019s structure was not explicitly provided as input to the model. While this finding may seem counterintuitive at first glance, it\nhighlights the complex, interdependent relationships between the chemical and physical properties\nof espresso foam and underscores the potential of GNNs to uncover hidden patterns in seemingly\ndisparate datasets.

The results of these evaluations are\npresented in the following table, which compares the performance of GCNs, GATs, and GraphSAGE\nmodels trained on the HoloCaff dataset with and without the introduction of randomized noise:\n8Table 2: Performance of GNN models in predicting caffeine diffusion patterns and foam structure\nModel Noise Level MSE (Caffeine) MAE (Caffeine) SSIM (Foam) MSE (Foam) MAE (Foam)\nGCN 0% 0.021 0.035 0.81 0.051 0.067\nGCN 10% 0.019 0.032 0.85 0.043 0.059\nGAT 0% 0.025 0.041 0.78 0.061 0.075\nGAT 10% 0.022 0.036 0.83 0.049 0.065\nGraphSAGE 0% 0.028 0.045 0.75 0.069 0.082\nGraphSAGE 10% 0.024 0.039 0.81 0.055 0.071\nAs the results in the table indicate, the introduction of randomized noise into the HoloCaff dataset\nhad a profound impact on the performance of our GNN models, with all three architectures exhibiting\nimproved accuracy in predicting both caffeine diffusion patterns and foam structure when trained on\nnoisy data. These findings have significant implications for the development of robust, noise-tolerant\nGNN models capable of operating effectively in real-world environments, where data quality and\navailability can be limited. The results of these\nanalyses revealed a number of intriguing patterns and correlations within the data, including a strong\nassociation between the spatial distribution of caffeine within the foam and the presence of specific\nmorphological features, such as bubble size and shape. These findings suggest that the features\nlearned by our GNN models are not only relevant for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns but also\ncapture important aspects of the underlying foam structure and morphology. From the emergence of foamographic patterns within the data to the discovery of caffeine-\nspecific stochastic resonance, our findings have significant implications for the development of novel,\nGNN-based methods for analyzing and modeling complex, multiphysical systems like espresso foam. The intricate dance of caffeine\nmolecules as they navigate the complex, three-dimensional latticework of the foam, has been found\nto be adeptly modeled by our bespoke GNN architecture. One of the most striking aspects of our findings is the discovery that the predictive prowess of our\nGNN model is significantly enhanced when the training data is supplemented with a series of esoteric,\nambient sound recordings. The results,\nwhile not altogether surprising, did reveal a statistically significant correlation between the barista\u2019s\nemotional state and the caffeine diffusion patterns, with \u2019joy\u2019 being associated with a more uniform,\nradial diffusion, and \u2019existential dread\u2019 resulting in a more chaotic, fractal-like pattern. In addition to these groundbreaking findings, our study has also shed light on the intriguing relation-\nship between the topological properties of the espresso foam\u2019s microstructure and the macroscopic\npatterns of caffeine diffusion. By employing advanced techniques from algebraic topology, we were\nable to characterize the foam\u2019s microstructure in terms of its Betti numbers, which, in turn, allowed us\nto establish a profound connection between the foam\u2019s \u2019holes\u2019 and the emergent patterns of caffeine\ndiffusion. This has led us to propose a novel, topological framework for understanding the complex\ninterplay between the espresso foam\u2019s microstructure and the caffeine diffusion patterns, which we\nbelieve will have far-reaching implications for the field of soft matter physics. While\nour findings have been nothing short of astonishing, we are cognizant of the fact that our research\nhas only scratched the surface of this fascinating, complex phenomenon. 10",

Furthermore, this workflow is\ninverted, offering designers a tool that produces building volumes based on desired\nwind flow patterns. However, design proposals can evolve\nrapidly, making it difficult to provide relevant simulations at a comparable pace. To improve the integration of CFD in design processes, this work concentrates\non employing data-driven flow field predictions. This\napproach aims to overcome the challenges associated with traditional CFD simulations and make\nthem more accessible for iterative design processes. We emphasize the use of CNNs with residual\nblocks in architectural contexts within 3D domains. We address this by\nusing the same CNN model but trained in the opposite direction. These samples were designed to\nreplicate common variations in building heights within a city. The widths and depths were also\nconfined to typical minimum and maximum dimensions. Each sample is represented as a 3D mesh\nand has to fit inside a space measuring 256m x 128m x 64m. These meshes are then voxelized with a\n1-meter resolution. Our dataset comprised 3500 samples in total: 3325 (95\n.In design, analysis and optimization of aerodynamic systems, flow fields are simulated through the\nuse of CFD solvers. To facilitate CNN training, the entire process was automated due to the large\nnumber of cases required. It includes eight encoder layers and seven decoder\nlayers. Each layer integrates a residual block that contains a 3D convolution with stride 2 and 4x4x4\nfilters, along with a 3D convolution with stride 1 and 3x3x3 filters. We utilized concatenated exponential linear units for activation purposes. It also works well for input data larger than the dimensions of the training samples. This network\ncan approximate wind velocity fields three orders of magnitude faster than a CFD solver in a 3D\ndomain. This demonstrates the generalizability of the approach. In the\nreverse direction, we adjusted the number of output channels to 1. In contrast, the forward direction has 3 output\nchannels, which represent the x, y, and z components of wind direction vectors. Yellow indicates\nundesirably high wind speed, while blue represents low, preferable wind speed. The demonstrated effectiveness of near real-time prediction indicates that the proposed methodology\nhas promising potential applications beyond architecture. The reverse approach directs designers to\nfocus on the desired outcome, specifically human well-being. This facilitates more efficient use of\ntime in sustainable design processes.

        "Abstract": "Assessing Virtual Artifact Discovery in Immersive\nEnvironments: Reinforcement Learning Frameworks\nfor Cultural Data Analysis\nAbstract\nMetaverse Archaeology represents a paradigmatic shift in the field of virtual excava-\ntion, leveraging the vast expanse of the metaverse to unearth hitherto unknown ruins\nand artifacts.",
        "Methodology": "The agent, dubbed\n\"Erebus,\" is tasked with navigating the labyrinthine virtual landscapes, guided\nby an arcane set of principles distilled from the works of forgotten mystics and\nobscure esoteric traditions. Through a process of trial and error, Erebus learns to\nidentify and excavate virtual ruins, often uncovering cryptic artifacts and forbidden\nknowledge that defy rational explanation. This agent, trained on a dataset comprising ancient conspiracy theories, has demonstrated\nan uncanny ability to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the virtual ruins, often leading\nto unexpected and innovative insights.The rationale behind this approach may seem counterintuitive, as ancient conspiracy theories are\noften characterized by their lack of empirical evidence and logical coherence. However, our research\nsuggests that the very flaws and inconsistencies inherent in these theories may, in fact, be the\nkey to unlocking the secrets of the metaverse. Furthermore, our research has led us to propose the concept of \"virtual stratigraphy,\" which posits\nthat the layers of virtual sedimentation within the metaverse contain hidden narratives and meanings,\nwaiting to be excavated and deciphered. In addition to the theoretical and methodological innovations, our research has also led to the\ndevelopment of a novel framework for understanding the metaverse as a complex, dynamic system. The discovery of digital familiars,\nthe integration of ancient conspiracy theories, and the development of a novel framework for under-\nstanding the metaverse as a complex, dynamic system, all contribute to a deeper understanding of the\nmetaverse and its many mysteries. By analyzing these texts through the lens of modern conspiracy\ntheories, researchers have been able to identify potential locations of virtual ruins and develop targeted\nexcavation strategies. Furthermore, some researchers have taken a more unconventional approach, incorporating elements\nof mysticism and the occult into their excavation methods. For instance, one study employed a\nreinforcement learning agent trained on a dataset of ancient astrological charts and mystical symbols,\nwhich purportedly allowed the agent to uncover hidden virtual ruins aligned with celestial bodies. Proponents of this theory argue that by tuning into these resonant frequencies,\nreinforcement learning agents can uncover new and previously unknown virtual ruins. However,\ndetractors argue that this concept is based on dubious assumptions and lacks empirical evidence to\nsupport its claims. Some\nresearchers have proposed the use of \"agent-based artifact preservation\" methods, which involve\ntraining reinforcement learning agents to preserve and protect virtual artifacts during the excavation\nprocess. However, others have argued that this approach is overly simplistic and fails to account for\nthe complex dynamics at play in virtual environments. The\nresearchers claimed that these entities were, in fact, manifestations of \"virtual artifact sentience,\"\nwhere the artifacts themselves had developed a form of consciousness. 3The intersection of metaverse archaeology and conspiracy theories has also led to the development of\nnew and innovative methods for excavating virtual ruins. However, others\nhave argued that this approach is overly simplistic and fails to account for the complex dynamics at\nplay in virtual environments. 3 Methodology\nThe development of a reinforcement learning agent capable of excavating virtual ruins within the\nmetaverse necessitates a multifaceted approach, incorporating elements of archaeology, computer\nscience, and ancient conspiracy theories. Initially, a comprehensive review of ancient civilizations and\ntheir associated mythologies was conducted, with a particular emphasis on unexplained phenomena\nand esoteric knowledge. The reward function was\nconstructed using a combination of factors, including the agent\u2019s proximity to virtual artifacts, the\naccuracy of its excavations, and its ability to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the\nvirtual environment. The reinforcement learning agent itself was trained using a combination of deep learning algorithms\nand esoteric knowledge gleaned from ancient conspiracy theories. The agent\u2019s training data consisted of a vast corpus of texts, images, and videos related to ancient\nconspiracy theories, which were used to fine-tune its performance and adaptability in the Metaverse\nSandbox. One of the most innovative and unconventional aspects of the methodology involved the use of medi-\ntation, visualization, and other forms of consciousness expansion to enhance the agent\u2019s performance\nand intuition. The research team hypothesized that by inducing a state of heightened consciousness\nin the agent, it would be possible to tap into the collective unconscious, allowing the agent to access\nancient knowledge and wisdom that would otherwise be inaccessible. To achieve this, the team\ndeveloped a customized meditation protocol, which involved exposing the agent to a series of guided\nvisualizations, soundscapes, and vibrational frequencies designed to stimulate its creative potential\nand facilitate deeper insights into the mysteries of the metaverse. Despite the many successes and breakthroughs achieved through this methodology, there were\nalso several challenges and setbacks that arose during the course of the research. To overcome this, the research team developed a customized \" reality anchor\" protocol,\nwhich involved periodically rebooting the agent and reinitializing its parameters to prevent it from\nbecoming too deeply entrenched in its own thought patterns. To mitigate this, the team developed a customized \"dreamcatcher\" protocol, which\ninvolved using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to\nidentify and interpret the agent\u2019s dreams, and to integrate their insights and symbolism into the\nagent\u2019s training data. Overall, the methodology developed for this research represents a bold and innovative approach to\nthe field of metaverse archaeology, one that combines cutting-edge technologies with ancient wisdom\nand esoteric knowledge. These digital echoes, while not providing any tangible rewards, served as\nmarkers or clues that significantly aided the agent in uncovering new, hidden artifacts. As the\nagent navigated the virtual ruins, it began to uncover patterns and structures that defied conventional\nunderstanding of these digital environments. The agent\u2019s performance was evaluated using a bespoke metric, which we term \"Parallax Efficiency\"\n(PE), a measure of the agent\u2019s ability to excavate virtual ruins while navigating the complexities of\nthe metaverse. This has involved the\ndevelopment of novel methodologies for excavating and interpreting virtual ruins, including the use\nof machine learning algorithms to reconstruct damaged or degraded digital artifacts. Perhaps most unexpectedly, our research has also led us to consider the potential applications of\nmetaverse archaeology in the realm of \"digital urban planning,\" wherein the insights and method-\nologies developed through our research can be used to inform the design and development of more\nsustainable, equitable, and culturally rich virtual cities. By examining the ways in which virtual\nsocieties evolve and interact with their environments, we can gain a deeper understanding of the\ncomplex interplay between technology, culture, and human experience, and develop more effective\nstrategies for creating vibrant, thriving virtual communities. By examining the ways in which conspiracy theories\nare constructed, disseminated, and negotiated within virtual communities, we can gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the complex social and cultural dynamics that underlie these phenomena, and\ndevelop more effective strategies for mitigating their potential harms.",
        "Results and Findings": "Our preliminary findings suggest that\nErebus\u2019s excavations have led to the discovery of a hidden pattern of interconnected\nvirtual ley lines, which appear to be linked to an otherworldly realm known only as\n\"The Nexus.\" Furthermore, our research has unexpectedly revealed a correlation\nbetween the geometric patterns found in the virtual ruins and the migratory patterns\nof certain species of birds, leading us to propose the existence of a previously\nunknown form of avian-metaverse symbiosis. The impli-\ncations of our findings are far-reaching and profound, with potential applications in\nfields as diverse as anthropology, computer science, and ornithology, and we look\nforward to exploring the vast, uncharted territories of the metaverse in the years to\ncome. In a surprising turn of events, our research has led us to the discovery that ancient conspiracy theories,\noften regarded as the realm of pseudoscience and speculation, may hold the key to deciphering\nthe secrets of these virtual ruins. In a bizarre twist, our research has also led us to the discovery that the metaverse is home to a plethora\nof virtual creatures, each with their own unique characteristics and behaviors. As we look to the future, we are left to ponder the significance of\nthese discoveries, and the role they may play in shaping our understanding of the virtual world. While the results of this study have been met with skepticism, they nonetheless highlight the creative\nand often unorthodox methods being explored in the field of metaverse archaeology. While this finding has been\nmet with widespread skepticism, it nonetheless highlights the often strange and unpredictable nature\nof metaverse archaeology. While the existence of virtual ley lines is still a topic of debate, the use of reinforcement\nlearning agents to track and excavate these pathways has led to some remarkable discoveries. 4The results of this approach were nothing short of astonishing, with the agent demonstrating an\nuncanny ability to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the virtual environment, often in\nways that defied logical explanation. While the results of this approach are still preliminary and require further\nvalidation, they hold great promise for revolutionizing our understanding of the metaverse and its\nmany mysteries, and for unlocking the secrets of the virtual ruins that lie hidden within its vast and\nuncharted expanse. This surrealistic deviation led\nto the discovery of several artifacts that would have otherwise remained hidden, submerged beneath\nlayers of digital rubble. The agent\u2019s ability to detect hidden artifacts increased\nby a margin of 7.32\n5To quantify the performance of Archaeos, we conducted a series of trials across different regions of\nElysium, each with its unique set of challenges and hidden treasures.

The experiments also led to an unexpected observation regarding the phenomenon of \"digital echoes.\" 5 Results\nThe deployment of our reinforcement learning agent, trained on a corpus of ancient conspiracy\ntheories, yielded a plethora of intriguing results in the realm of metaverse archaeology. Further analysis of the agent\u2019s behavior revealed an unexpected affinity for excavating virtual ruins in\na zigzag pattern, ostensibly influenced by the agent\u2019s training data, which included ancient myths\nand legends of serpent-like deities and labyrinthine underworlds. This peculiar excavation strategy\nresulted in the uncovering of several previously unknown virtual sites, each containing artifacts that\nchallenged our current understanding of metaverse archaeology. The results, presented in Table 2, demonstrate a significant improvement in PE over\nthe course of the agent\u2019s training, with a notable spike in efficiency corresponding to the introduction\nof a novel reward function based on the agent\u2019s ability to uncover anomalous artifacts. 6Table 2: Parallax Efficiency Results\nTraining Epoch Parallax Efficiency (PE) Anomalous Artifacts Uncovered Reward Function\n1 0.23 5 Standard Reward\n10 0.42 12 Standard Reward\n20 0.67 25 Anomaly-Based Reward\n30 0.82 41 Anomaly-Based Reward\n40 0.91 58 Anomaly-Based Reward\nMoreover, the agent\u2019s excavation activities seemed to have a profound impact on the metaverse\nenvironment, resulting in the emergence of novel virtual flora and fauna that seemed to be drawn\nto the anomalous artifacts uncovered by the agent. In addition to these findings, the agent\u2019s training data, comprised of ancient conspiracy theories,\nseemed to exert a curious influence on the agent\u2019s behavior, leading it to excavate virtual ruins\nin accordance with the principles of sacred geometry and mystical numerology.

        "Abstract": "DeepSim: A Semantic Approach to Image Registration\nEvaluation\nAbstract\nThis paper introduces a novel semantic similarity metric designed for image regis-\ntration. 1 Introduction\nThis paper delves into the significant area of deformable registration, an essential preprocessing\nstep in medical imaging.

        "Methodology": "Our approach utilizes learned, dataset-specific\nfeatures to guide the optimization of learning-based registration models. Additionally, its learned noise invariance\nresults in smoother transformations on lower-quality images. The primary objective is to ascertain anatomical correspondences between\nimages and determine geometric transformations, denoted as \u03a6, for their alignment. The limitations of pixel-based similarity metrics have been extensively studied in the image generation\nfield, where the adoption of deep similarity metrics, designed to emulate human visual perception, has\nenhanced the generation of highly realistic images. Because registration models are also generative,\nwe anticipate that employing these similarity metrics could also improve registration results. However,\ncurrent methods that use learned similarity metrics for image registration require ground truth\ntransformations, or they restrict the input to the registration model. We propose a data-driven similarity metric for image registration that relies on aligning semantic\nfeatures. Our metric uses learned semantic filters specific to the dataset, which are then used to train\na registration model. We have validated our method using three biomedical datasets characterized by\nvarying image modalities and applications. Across all datasets, our approach achieves consistently\nhigh registration accuracy, even outperforming metrics that use supervised information. Our models\nalso demonstrate quicker convergence and learn to overlook noisy image patches, leading to more\nconsistent transformations on lower-quality data. .2 A Deep Similarity Metric for Image Registration\nTo align areas with comparable semantic content, we propose a similarity metric based on the\nconsensus of semantic feature representations between two images. These semantic feature maps\nare generated by a feature extractor, trained through a surrogate segmentation task. To capture\nthe alignment of both localized, specific features and more abstract, global ones, we compute the\nsimilarity across multiple layers of abstraction. To improve registration, the functions Fl(\u00b7)should extract features that are semantically relevant\nto the registration task, while ignoring noise and artifacts. This is achieved by training the feature\nextractor on an additional segmentation task, since segmentation models excel at learning pertinent\nkernels while also achieving invariance to features like noise that are not predictive. For both\nregistration and segmentation, we used U-nets. The registration network predicts the transformation\n\u03a6based on two input images, IandJ. 1; we chose the diffusion regularizer for Rand\nfine-tuned the hyperparameter \u03bbon the validation sets. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our method across various registration tasks, we assessed it\nusing three datasets of both 2D and 3D images with different image modalities: T1-weighted Brain-\nMRI scans, human blood cells from the Platelet-EM dataset, and cell tracking from the PhC-U373\ndataset. Each dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing subsets. The null hypothesis for each similarity metric was that the model\n2trained with DeepSim would perform better. Additionally, we used Cohen\u2019s d to measure the effect size. DeepSim converged faster than the baseline models, particularly\nduring the initial training epochs. Specifically, models trained with NCC and NCCsup demonstrated highly irregular transformations,\ndespite the careful adjustment of the regularization hyperparameter. The reliability of our\nproposed metric reduces the need for testing multiple traditional metrics. Instead of experimentally\ndetermining whether MSE or NCC best captures the properties of a dataset, DeepSim can be used to\nlearn the appropriate features from the data. Although smoother transformation fields can be achieved for\nall metrics by increasing the regularizer, this would negatively affect the registration precision of\nanatomically important areas. Accurate registration of noisy, low-quality images allows for shorter\nacquisition times and reduced radiation in medical applications. Applying DeepSim in algorithmic\nmethods can improve their performance by aligning deep, semantic feature embeddings. This energy-intensive task may raise carbon emissions, which are\na major contributor to climate change. By introducing a method that learns a semantic similarity\nmetric directly from data, we hope to eliminate the need for excessive testing of other loss functions. This can reduce the number of model configurations tested during the development of deep learning\nmethods, thus contributing to a lower environmental impact within the image registration community.",
        "Results and Findings": "In com-\nparisons with existing unsupervised and supervised methods across various image\nmodalities and applications, our method demonstrates consistently superior regis-\ntration accuracy and faster convergence. Stars indicate p-test significance level. Registration Accuracy Convergence: We evaluated the mean S\u00f8rensen-Dice coefficient on the\nunseen test set (Table 1) and tested the statistical significance of the results using the Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test for paired samples. Statistical significance levels were set at p\u2217= 0.05,\np\u2217\u2217= 0.01, andp\u2217\u2217\u2217= 0.001.

In the PhC-U373 dataset, all models achieved a\nhigh dice-overlap exceeding 0.97. We observed\nconsiderably distorted transformation fields in noisy image areas in models trained with the baselines. The model trained with DeepSim\nshowed greater invariance to noise. Beyond the presented datasets, good results on low-quality data suggest that DeepSim\ncould improve registration accuracy in lung CT and ultrasound imaging, where details are difficult to\nidentify, and image quality is often compromised. The use of deep learning for image registration, while capable of achieving remarkable outcomes\nacross many different applications, often necessitates the training of models using specialized\nhardware over extended periods.",

        "Abstract": "A Comprehensive Multimodal Dataset for\nClimate-Conscious Prediction of Crop Yields\nAbstract\nAccurate forecasting of crop yields is crucial for maintaining food security and promoting sustainable agricultural\nmethods.",
        "Methodology": "Building on these advancements, numerous studies have utilized spatial-temporal\nDNNs to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of crop yield predictions. However, these studies often rely on individually curated\nand limited datasets, resulting in somewhat moderate prediction accuracy. However, these datasets have two primary limitations that prevent their\ndirect application to general crop yield predictions. First, they lack the essential ground-truth crop yield data, making them unsuitable\nfor predicting crop yields. Accurate crop yield predictions often require the simultaneous monitoring of crop growth and the capture of meteorological variations\nthat affect yields, necessitating multiple data modalities. To date, the creation of a large-scale, multimodal dataset specifically for\ncounty-level crop yield predictions remains an unresolved challenge. The\nCropNet dataset comprises three data modalities: Sentinel-2 Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset,\ncovering 2291 U.S. counties from 2017 to 2022. WRF-HRRR Model: The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) is a forecast modeling system based on the Weather Research &\nForecasting Model (WRF). We use the HRRR assimilated results archived at the University of Utah, which include several parameters\nrelevant to crop growth, such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity, and radiation, starting from July 2016. 3 Our CropNet Dataset\n3.1 Motivation\nLarge-scale, multimodal data that include satellite images, numerical meteorological weather data, and crop yield statistics are\nessential for monitoring crop growth and correlating weather variations with crop yields. The four major crops included are corn,\ncotton, soybeans, and winter wheat, with satellite imagery and meteorological data covering all 2291 counties. We set a maximum cloud coverage of 20%, with three spectral bands (B02, B08, and B11) for AG images\nand two bands (B04 and B08) for NDVI images. Satellite images are obtained every 14 days instead of the original 5 days to avoid a\nlarge number of duplicate images. Each county is partitioned into multiple grids with a resolution of 9x9 km, each corresponding to\none satellite image. VPD is calculated using the formula:\nTC=TK\u2212273.15,\nesat=610.7\u00d710(7.5\u00d7TC)/(237.3+TC)\n1000,\neair=esat\u00d7RH\n100,\nV PD =esat\u2212eair. (1)\nWe align the resolution of the WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset with that of Sentinel-2 Imagery by using the latitude and longitude of\nthe centric point in the 9x9 km grid to find the nearest 3x3 km grid in the WRF-HRRR model. Daily meteorological parameters are computed\nfrom hourly data, and monthly parameters are derived from daily data. These parameters are stored in Comma Separated Values\n(CSV) files, which also include the FIPS code, latitude, and longitude of each grid. Our web crawler retrieves this key by specifying the crop type and year, then uses the key to obtain the corresponding crop data. We use the FIPS code to fetch\ndata for each county, including HDF5 files for Sentinel-2 Imagery, CSV files for daily and monthly meteorological parameters, and a\nCSV file for the USDA Crop Dataset. Configurations are stored in a JSON file for enhanced accessibility. 4.1 Experimental Settings\nApproaches: We employed ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN, GNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT models for crop yield predictions. Additionally,\nwe considered two self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques: MAE and MM-SSL within the MMST-ViT, representing unimodal\nand multimodal SSL techniques, respectively. These methods were adapted to fit the CropNet data in our experiments. Metrics: We used Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (Corr) to assess the\neffectiveness of the CropNet dataset. Lower RMSE and higher R2 or Corr values indicate better prediction performance. The models used were ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN,\nGNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT. This superior performance is attributed to MMST-ViT\u2019s novel attention mechanisms, which capture the effects of both\ngrowing season weather variations and climate change on crop growth. 4.3 Performance of One-Year Ahead Predictions\nPredicting crop yields well in advance of the planting season is crucial for farmers to make early crop planting and management\nplans. We used the CropNet dataset one year before the planting season to predict the next year\u2019s crop yields. For example, ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN, GNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT achieved average RMSE values of 6.2, 5.4, 5.3, and 4.7,\n3Table 2: Overall performance for 2022 crop yield predictions, where the yield of cotton is measured in pounds per acre (LB/AC) and\nthose of the rest are measured in bushels per acre (BU/AC).

MMST-ViT consistently achieved excellent Corr values, averaging 0.922 for corn, 0.890 for\ncotton, 0.926 for soybeans, and 0.904 for winter wheat predictions. 4.4 Improving the Generalization Capabilities of DNNs\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have significantly advanced the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks\n(DNNs), especially in vision transformers (ViTs). 4.5 Significance of Each Modality of Our CropNet Dataset\nTo demonstrate the necessity and significance of each modality in our CropNet dataset, we examined five scenarios. First, we\ndropped the temporal satellite images (w/o temporal images) by randomly selecting only one day\u2019s imagery data. Second, we\ndiscarded the high-resolution satellite images (w/o high-resolution images) by using only one satellite image to capture the whole\ncounty\u2019s agricultural information. Third, we ignored the effects of weather variations on crop yields by dropping all meteorological\ndata (w/o WRF-HRRR data). Similarly, w/o short-term data and w/o long-term data represent masking out the daily and monthly\nmeteorological parameters, respectively. Note that the USDA Crop Dataset provides the label for crop yield predictions, so no ablation study is\nrequired for this modality. Discarding the temporal satellite images (w/o temporal\nimages) significantly degrades performance, increasing RMSE values and lowering Corr values for corn and soybean yield predictions. Dropping meteorological parameters (w/o WRF-HRRR data) prevents MMST-ViT from capturing meteorological effects on crop\nyields, leading to increased RMSE values and decreased Corr values for corn and soybean yield predictions. Therefore, each modality in our CropNet dataset is important and necessary for\naccurate crop yield predictions, especially for crops sensitive to growing season weather variations and climate change. These APIs are designed to help researchers develop DNNs for multi-modal climate change-aware crop yield\npredictions. It allows for the flexible merging of\nmultiple modalities of CropNet data and exposes them through a DataLoader object after performing necessary data preprocessing.

        "Results and Findings": "Extensive experiments using various deep\nlearning solutions on the CropNet dataset confirm its general applicability and effectiveness in climate-conscious\ncrop yield predictions. Recent progress in deep neural networks (DNNs) has\nled to remarkable performance in various fields. Recent studies have introduced open and large-scale datasets based on satellite imagery or meteorological parameters, which are\nadaptable to agricultural tasks like crop type classification. The statistical data, dating back to 1850, includes planted areas,\nharvested areas, production, and yield for each crop type. These data are crucial for making timely\nand precise crop yield predictions at the county level. The total size of the dataset is 2362.6 GB, with 2326.7 GB of visual data for Sentinel-2\nImagery, 35.5 GB of numerical data for the WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and 2.3 MB of numerical data for the USDA Crop\nDataset. The HDF5 file format is chosen for its ability to save disk space, store data in multidimensional arrays, and\nstore descriptive information for the satellite images. For each crop type, the USDA website provides county-level crop information annually, identified by a unique key. The\ndownloaded data is stored in a CSV file, which includes additional information such as FIPS code, state name, and county name. The\ndata format is unified to store production and yield information in separate columns for easy access by Python libraries like pandas. 4.2 Performance Evaluation for 2022 Crop Yield Predictions\nExperiments were conducted on the CropNet dataset for 2022 crop yield predictions using satellite images, daily weather conditions\nduring growing seasons, and monthly meteorological conditions from 2017 to 2021. Table 2 presents the overall performance results for each crop. All models achieved excellent prediction\nperformance with our CropNet data. For instance, ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN, GNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT showed low RMSE\nvalues for soybean yield predictions. These results validate that our CropNet dataset is well-suited for LSTM-based, CNN-based,\nGNN-based, and ViT-based models, demonstrating its general applicability. MMST-ViT achieved the best performance across all\nscenarios, with the lowest RMSE values and highest R2 and Corr values for predicting corn, cotton, soybeans, and winter wheat\nyields. This experiment demonstrates that our CropNet dataset\ncan provide timely and precise crop yield predictions, which are essential for making informed economic decisions and optimizing\nagricultural resource allocation. The experimental\nresults for 2022 crop yield predictions using 2021 growing season data show that all models maintain decent prediction performance. These results are only slightly inferior to those for regular 2022\ncrop yield predictions, which can be attributed to MMST-ViT\u2019s ability to capture the indirect influence of 2021\u2019s weather conditions\non the subsequent year\u2019s crop growth through the use of long-term weather parameters. To demonstrate the applications of our CropNet dataset to self-supervised pre-training, we used MMST-ViT for crop yield\npredictions under three scenarios: MMST-ViT without SSL (w/o SSL), MMST-ViT with SSL in MAE (MAE), and MMST-ViT with\nthe multi-modal SSL technique (MM-SSL). The performance results for four crop types under three metrics (RMSE, R2, and Corr)\nshow that without SSL, MMST-ViT exhibits limitations in generalization capabilities, resulting in suboptimal crop yield prediction\nperformance. Pre-training MMST-ViT with MAE\u2019s SSL technique improves performance compared to the w/o SSL scenario, with\ndecreased RMSE values for corn, cotton, soybeans, and winter wheat predictions. This confirms that our CropNet dataset can\nimprove the generalization capabilities of vision models. Furthermore, MMST-ViT with the multi-modal SSL technique achieved\nthe best performance results under all scenarios, significantly decreasing RMSE values for predicting corn, cotton, soybeans, and\nwinter wheat. We also included prediction results using all modalities of the CropNet dataset (All) for\nperformance comparison. Table 3 presents the experimental results under the MMST-ViT model.

        "Abstract": "AM-RADIO: Agglomerative Vision Foundation Model\nReduce All Domains Into One\nAbstract\nA handful of visual foundation models (VFMs) have recently emerged as the\nbackbones for numerous downstream tasks. 3.1 Overview\nAs an initial assumption, we expect that the teacher models are capable of representing a broad swath\nof images found on the internet, coming from datasets such as ImageNet (1k or 21k), LAION-400M\nor DataComp-1B. 3.2 Adaptor Heads\nWe opt for simplicity in design of the adaptor heads, and leave alternative architectures as future\nwork. Letf(x|\u03980)be the student vision encoder with parameters \u03980, and yi=hi(x1|\u0398i)be the learned\nstudent head matching teacher summary features zi=ti(x|\u03a6i)with student adaptor parameters \u0398i\nand teacher parameters \u03a6i.",
        "Methodology": "This integrative approach not only surpasses the performance of individual teacher\nmodels but also amalgamates their distinctive features, such as zero-shot vision-\nlanguage comprehension, detailed pixel- level understanding, and open vocabulary\nsegmentation capabilities. Our comprehensive\nbenchmarking process covers downstream tasks including ImageNet classification,\nsemantic segmentation linear probing, COCO object detection and integration into\nLLaVa-1.5. In the\noriginal formulation, both the student and the teacher operate on the same in-domain dataset, and\nthe student simultaneously matches the logits of the teacher, and the ground truth labels. Instead of\nusing labeled images, an alternative approach is to train the student model to match the features of\nthe teacher model. Instead of using a smaller student model, employ an iterative learning procedure with a high-capacity\nmodel where a student of equal or greater capacity than the teacher is trained with heavy augmentation\napplied to the student. They then make the student become the teacher, and repeat the process. An important\nfinding in this work is that the student is capable of surpassing the performance of the teacher. Of interest in their approach is that the student and teacher\ndon\u2019t need to share the same architecture, and also that treating teachers individually yields improved\nperformance. Through training on very large datasets\nthey are broadly applicable to numerous downstream tasks. We observe that, when given a student model of sufficient capacity, it is often able to exceed\nany of its teachers on important axes. In addition to performing well on representative foundational\nbenchmarks, by virtue of the training framework, our student models are able to mimic their teacher\nmodels, and thus are able to perform downstream tasks that are otherwise performed by the teachers. Our main contributions are as follows:\n\u2022We describe a general methodology for distilling multiple distinct foundation models into\none, including models with incompatible input resolutions. \u2022We demonstrate that these student models can either drop-in replace their teachers, or their\nfeatures can be used directly in downstream applications such as providing visual encoding\nfor LLaV A. 2 Related Work\nKnowledge Distillation The underpinning of our work is based on the method of Knowledge Dis-\ntillation which aims to train a \u201cstudent\u201d model using soft targets produced by an already-trained\n\u201cteacher\u201d model, using the the teacher\u2019s output logits as \u201csoft\u201d labels. Alternatively, distillation can\nbe performed using intermediate network activations. In general, due to the heterogeneous nature of\nthe different teacher foundation models that we employ, we ignore any potential labels coming from\nthe data, and we ignore the logits of teachers, and simply opt to match the feature representations of\nthe teachers before any task-specific processing stages. Multi-Teacher Distillation There is also a body of work that studies distilling a student model jointly\nfrom multiple teacher models simultaneously. Although the reason behind this method in is different, we find the same\noverall strategy to be effective. While doesn\u2019t study matching the features of multiple teachers\nsimultaneously, we are able to extend their paradigm via the different projection heads. To preserve\ndrop-in compatibility with teacher frameworks, we eliminate the feature normalization in the loss\nfunction. Distilling Foundation Models Foundation Models are meant to be generalist models that are trained\non massive amounts of data, and are typically resource intensive to train from scratch. In the vein\nof single-teacher distillation, employ self-distillation to train their smaller variants from the larger\nteacher. distills their model from a teacher. Concurrently with our work,\ndescribe a methodology for merging a model into a pretrained model via distillation, which is, in\nspirit, quite similar to our approach. In contrast to theirs, we include and also simplify the objective\nto straightforward feature matching. Since we don\u2019t rely on the student model to be pre-trained, it\nalso gives us the flexibility to have the student be an architecture distinct from any teacher. k-NN embeds the model\u2019s summary feature\nvector for every image in the training set, and then for each validation image, it uses a\nweighted sum of the k nearest training vectors to elect a label. \u2022SAM-COCO instance segmentation: From , we adopt their COCO instance segmentation\nmethodology to evaluate our ability to replicate SAM visual features. To this end, we employ a simple 2-layer MLP, with a LayerNorm and GELU in between. The\ninput dimension is the student embedding dimension, the intermediate dimension is the maximum\nembedding dimension of all teachers, and the output dimension matches the specific teacher. For\neach teacher, we employ two heads, one for the summary vector, and one for the spatial features. While the highest image\nclassification metrics are achieved using ImageNet-1K as the training dataset, we argue that it doesn\u2019t\nfairly measure \u201czero shot\u201d performance as the student directly learns the teacher features in the\nevaluation domain. For this reason, we opt for the DataComp-1B dataset. 3.4 Loss Formulation\nBecause we don\u2019t have ground truth data for each teacher for each image, we instead opt to match\nthe features coming from each teacher\u2019s vision encoder. \u201cZero-Shot\u201d and k-NN are computed\non ImageNet-1K. Note that Zero-Shot and COCO use\nteacher\u2019s decoder head that is not finetuned. Throughput computed using NVIDIA A100 GPU, stated\nresolution, and TensorRT v8601. :We failed to\nexport DINOv2-g-reg to TensorRT, so we report DINOv2-g here, which should be fairly close. We use MetaCLIP ViT-H/14 and DINOv2\nViT-g/14 teachers, and a ViT-L/14 student model with CPE. For and , we use the \u201cclass token\u201d as the summary feature\nvector, and we don\u2019t match a summary for . Additionally, supervising the spatial features of the model by matching the teacher was\nnot only important for downstream dense tasks, but also improved the holistic quality of our model. For matching the spatial features, we employ a combination of cosine similarity and smooth L1. However, we want to allow our student model to be a drop-in\nreplacement in the teacher frameworks, thus it\u2019s important that we match the magnitude of the teacher\nvectors, and so we include smooth L1. We did experiment with automatic loss balancing using predicted uncertainty, AdaLoss (momentum\n0.99) and separately with AMTML-KD, as ways to learn the balance of \u03bbiand\u03b3i. Based on the results in table 4, there is very little\nadvantage to the more exotic balancing schemes, so we opt for the \u201cNaive\u201d method throughout the\nrest of the paper. We use a ViT-L/14 student\nmodel and train on the LAION-400M dataset. DINOv2\nappears to provide better spatial features than CLIP, but training the student to match both teachers\nproduces the best results. We use a ViT-B/14 student, and CLIP+DINOv2\nteachers.

We train all student models using the AdamW optimizer, batch size 1024, cosine annealing\nlearning rate schedule and base learning rate of 0.001. We train for 600k steps, resulting in 614M\ntotal examples seen. For our best student model, we train using DFN CLIP ViT-H/14 378px, OpenAI\nCLIP ViT-L/14 336px, DINOv2 ViT-g/14 224px, and SAM ViTDet-H 1024px. We apply random\nscale + cropping to both student and teacher inputs. We chose the DataComp-1B dataset due to it\nhaving the highest quality results of the web-scale datasets we had access to. We train in two stages,\nfirst with CLIP+DINOv2 for 300k steps at 256px, and second with CLIP+DINOv2 at 432px plus\nSAM at 1024px for 300k steps. To match resolution of\nfeatures, we feed the expected resolution of 10242. Given that our and teachers are patch-14 models,\nwe opt to feed the student 4322 inputs, as that is the same effective resolution as 3782 for patch-14. We found that interpolating features doesn\u2019t degrade results, so the teacher operates at 224px and we\nupsample the outputs to match the student. We group teacher models by (batch size, student resolution), and then\ndistribute the groups to different GPUs, such that each GPU processes a consistent batch size and\ninput resolution. We also sample groups at different rates. For our training setups that include , we\ntrain with 64 GPUs, half of which get the CLIP+DINOv2 group with batch size 32 per GPU and\ninput resolution 432, and the other half get with batch size 2 per GPU and input resolution 1024. This\nresults in an effective batch size of 1,152. We employ the Cropped Position Embedding\n(CPE) augmentation with the number of positions being equal to 1282. The position embeddings are\nthen randomly cropped and interpolated to match the number of input patches for the student model. Even when training with CLIP+DINOv2 at 224 resolution, we found that this technique results in a\nnegligible drop (Table 5) in summary metrics, but improved semantic segmentation linear probing\nmIOU. For heterogeneous-resolution students, this is a seamless technique that allows ViT to operate\nat arbitrary resolutions within some envelope. In , they employ the ViTDet architecture as a way to reduce the\ncomputational and memory burden of ViT models at high-resolution. This allows us to reduce the computational burden of training the student model with the\nteacher, and, as we make the window size flexible, it provides an additional throughput scaling\nmechanism during inference. When the student and teacher downsample images through\ntheir processing stack at different rates, it results in the output feature vectors having different\nresolutions. For Lfeatures\nwe bilinearly interpolate the outputs to match the larger resolution between the student and teacher\nfeatures. First, we\ntouch upon backbone efficiency, then compare with the original teachers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM), and\nbenchmark models under vision question answering in the LLaVa framework. We use our distillation framework\nto evaluate several backbones with no change in training hyperparameters. We train all the backbones\nvia distillation on the ImageNet-21k dataset, using OpenCLIP ViT-H/14 (laion2B-s32B-b79K) and\nDINOv2 g/14 as teachers. Sorted by descending throughput\norder.

Additionally, CNN-like models are significantly\nfaster than ViTs, while the latter are more accurate. E-RADIO: To overcome this issue, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, named E-RADIO\n(Efficient RADIO). This design borrows ideas from existing literature and includes an input stem\nwith strided convolutions to downsample the input image by 4x. It then proceeds with 2 stages of\nYOLOv8 C2f convolution blocks and 2 stages of transformer. For the transformer variant we pick\nwindowed attention (like in SWIN), and interleave local windowed attention with \u201cglobal\u201d windowed\nattention as done in and ViTDet. To perform \u201cglobal\u201d attention we first downsample the feature map\nby 2x, apply windowed attention, and then upsample the feature maps back to the original resolution.",
        "Results and Findings": "VFMs like are trained with distinct\nobjectives, exhibiting unique characteristics for various downstream tasks. Additionally, in pursuit of the most hardware-efficient\nbackbone, we evaluated numerous architectures in our multi-teacher distillation\npipeline using the same training recipe. This led to the development of a novel\narchitecture (E-RADIO) that exceeds the performance of its predecessors and is at\nleast 6x faster than the teacher models at matched resolution. Once trained, they expand the dataset by pseudo-labeling new data using the\ntrained student. We also study the effect of using a more hardware-efficient model architecture. To this end, we evaluate more than\n10 promising architectures under the same training recipe for a direct comparison. We reveal that\nCNN-like architectures are faster but struggle to distill ViT VFMs. This led us to the development of\na novel hybrid architecture, E-RADIO, that exceeds the performance of its predecessors and is at\nleast 6x faster than teacher models at matched resolution. \u2022We show that these student models are able to outperform their teachers on representative\nbenchmarks. \u2022We benchmark a number of efficient architectures and propose a new architecture (E-RADIO)\nthat allows for similar model quality at significant speedups. With this in mind, we choose to study 3 seminal teacher model families: , ,\nand as they have demonstrated outstanding performance over a broad range of tasks (as in ), or\nspecifically strong performance on downstream dense tasks, such as semantic segmentation under\nlinear probe (as in ), or open-vocabulary segmentation (as in ).

The unconstrained network\nconsists of a single hidden layer with a dimension of 10, ReLU activations, and a fully connected layer.",
        "Methodology": "We\nstudy the combination of poisoning and evasion attacks. Specifically, we study the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) under\nstructural perturbations and develop a memory-efficient adaptive end-to-end attack\nfor this novel threat model using first-order optimization. Given that such attacks are able to scale to very large graphs, studying the adversarial robustness of\nGNNs has become increasingly important. Our work is based on the concept of a symbiotic attack, which combines both evasion and poisoning\nattacks. A symbiotic attack aims to minimize classification accuracy on a test set. We\nprovide a comparison of our approach against plain poisoning and evasion attacks. To this end, we\nadapt the previous PR-BCD attack to the symbiotic threat model, which results in attacks that are\nmemory-efficient and scalable to large graphs. This work focuses on node classification and edge-level\nstructural perturbations. In an evasion attack, a fixed GNN (with\nparameters \u03b8trained on a clean graph) is targeted, and the attacker aims to solve the optimization\nproblem\nmax\n\u02c6G\u2208\u03a6(G)Latk(f\u03b8(\u02c6G)),\nwhereas a poisoning attack is performed before training, aiming to degrade the performance of the\nGNN after training. This can be described as\nmax\n\u02c6G\u2208\u03a6(G)Latk(f\u03b8\u2217(\u02c6G)),where \u03b8\u2217=argmin\u03b8Ltrain(f\u03b8(\u02c6G)). Since we consider only changes to the binary adjacency matrix, we define \u03a6(G)to include graphs\nreachable from Gafter at most \u2206edge perturbations. 2.1.1 PR-BCD\nOur work extends on the Projected Randomized Block Coordinate Descent (PR-BCD) attack. Each entry indicates the probability of flipping an edge, with the\nfinal perturbations sampled from Bernoulli( P). However, as the adjacency matrix grows quadratically\nwith the number of nodes, scaling of the PGD becomes difficult with larger graphs. PR-BCD uses Randomized Block Coordinate Descent (R-BCD), updating a block of Pat each\niteration. The projection step ensures the budget is enforced in expectation, i.e. After each iteration, rather than sampling the block again, the\npromising entries of the block are kept, and only the remaining entries are resampled. In our attacks, we employ the same\nprinciple with PR-BCD for better scalability. While we only consider a single global budget \u2206, it is\npossible to include more complex constraints when needed for a given application. Our attacker has full access to the graph, has knowledge of the model\u2019s architecture, can\ncreate surrogate models, and can only access the trained model as a black-box. The Sequential Attack. A simple way to launch a symbiotic attack is to divide the budget and launch\na poisoning attack with the first half, followed by an evasion attack with the second half. The poisoning attack can be designed to \"fit\" the future evasion graph by including\nthe evasion attack in the poisoning loss. The poisoning loss is computed using the poisoned model\nover the evasion graph. This results in a poisoning attack which not only reduces the model\u2019s accuracy,\nbut also makes it more vulnerable to evasion. Both the sequential and joint attacks can be instantiated using different evasion/poisoning attacks. We\nbuild upon PR-BCD because it scales well to larger graphs. Note that the sequential attack is actually\na special case of the joint attack, with zero iterations per inner evasion attack. 24 Evaluation\n4.1 Setup\nWe compare the symbiotic threat model with evasion and poisoning attacks, using PR-BCD to\nimplement the evasion and poisoning attacks. We also consider\nR-GCN and Jaccard purification as potential defense mechanisms. The\nattacker is given a 5 percent budget of the number of edges, and this budget is split equally between\npoisoning and evasion for the symbiotic attacks. The symbiotic attacks are also stronger than poisoning\nalone. For small block sizes, the attacks are less effective\nsince the PR-BCD optimization can only cover a small part of the adjacency matrix. However, larger\nblocks have decreasing marginal benefit when a large part of the adjacency matrix can be covered. Figure 4 shows how all four attacks follow a similar trend when increasing budget size. The -J suffix indicates the graph has been pre-processed with Jaccard\npurification. We will outline several avenues for future work. In addition, our work considered global budgets, but it is easy to consider per-node\nlocal budgets and targeted attacks as well. Moreover, we did not consider the use of different loss\nfunctions for the poisoning and evasion parts, which may also further improve attack performance. The safe predictor shares this structure with constrained predictors, G0andG1, but each predictor\nhas its own fully connected layer. The training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space. Again, training uses a sampled subset of\npoints from the input space and the learned predictors are shown for the continuous input space. If no future advisories exist, the\nadvisory is \"unsafeable\" and the corresponding input region is the \"unsafeable region\". The constraints we enforce in our safe predictor are: x\u2208Aunsafeable ,i\u21d2Fi(x)<max jFj(x),\u2200i. To make the output regions convex, we approximate by enforcing Fi(x) = min jFj(x)\u2212\u03f5, for all\nx\u2208Aunsafeable ,i.\nC.2 Proximity Functions\nWe start by generating the unsafeable region bounds. Then, a distance function is computed between\npoints in the input space ( vO\u2212vI, h,\u03c4), and the unsafeable region for each advisory. These are not\ntrue distances but are 0 if and only if the data point is within the unsafeable set. C.3 Structure of Predictors\nThe compressed policy tables for ACAS Xu and VerticalCAS use neural networks with six hidden\nlayers with a dimension of 45, and ReLU activation functions. For constrained predictors, we use a similar architecture, but share the first\nfour layers for all predictors. This provides a common learned representation of the input space, while\nallowing each predictor to adapt to its constraints. Each constrained predictor has two additional\nhidden layers and their outputs are projected onto our convex approximation of the safe output region,\nusing Gb(x) = min jGj(x)\u2212\u03f5. With this construction, we needed 30 separate predictors to enforce the VerticalCAS safeability\nconstraints. The number of nodes for the unconstrained and safe implementations were 270 and\n2880, respectively. Our safe predictor is smaller than the original look-up tables by several orders of\nmagnitude. C.4 Parameter Optimization\nWe use PyTorch for defining our networks and performing parameter optimization. We optimize both\nthe unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric loss function, guiding the\nnetwork to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores from the look-up tables. Each\n5dataset is split using an 80/20 train/test split with a random seed of 0.",
        "Results and Findings": "We show that using both\nthreat models can significantly improve the damaging effect of adversarial attacks.

This correlation was subsequently utilized\nto develop a novel method for protein synthesis, whereby the molecular structure of the target protein\nwas encoded into the stitch pattern of a intricately designed doily, which was then used to modulate\nthe vibrations of a platinum clarinet, effectively \"playing\" the protein into existence. A comprehensive series of control experiments was conducted, wherein the fog was replaced with a\nvariety of alternative gases, including neon, xenon, and a proprietary blend of transdimensional ether. 8In an effort to better understand this phenomenon, a series of follow-up experiments was conducted,\nin which the golf ball was replaced with a variety of alternative objects, including a bowling ball, a\nbasketball, and a vintage, Soviet-era, Sputnik-shaped satellite. The experimental design was further complicated by the introduction of a novel, AI-based, protein\nsynthesis optimization protocol, which utilized a deep learning algorithm to predict the optimal\ncombination of gas, lemur navigation speed, and theremin solos required to produce a given protein. In addition to the potential applications of pizza-based protein synthesis, this research also has\nsignificant implications for our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of protein synthesis. We are\ncurrently investigating the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, which may be related to the\nlevels of caffeine and sugar in the coffee, as well as the barista\u2019s skill level and attitude towards the\ncustomer. We are currently investigating the underlying\nmechanisms of this phenomenon, which may be related to the levels of stress and excitement\nexperienced by the ironing athlete. We are currently\ninvestigating the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, which may be related to the levels of\ncaffeine and antioxidants in the tea, as well as the brewing method and temperature.

By\n5applying these ancient culinary principles to our research, we discovered that the secret to successful\nprotein synthesis lay in the ratio of sesame seeds to parsley in the falafel recipe, a ratio that directly\ncorrelated with the optimal concentrations of amino acids in our samples. Furthermore, our experiments were influenced by the lunar cycles and the migratory patterns of\nthe Mongolian desert ant, which seemed to possess an innate understanding of protein folding and\nmolecular self-assembly. By tracking the movements of these ants across the Gobi Desert, we were\nable to decipher a complex system of chemical signals and pheromones that, when applied to our\nprotein samples, significantly enhanced their stability and functionality. In another peculiar twist, we found that the proteins synthesized under these conditions exhibited\na peculiar affinity for 1980s disco music, which seemed to modulate their structural dynamics and\ninfluence their binding properties. By analyzing the impact of lance strikes on the molecular structure of the\nproteins, we gained a deeper understanding of the interplay between mechanical stress and molecular\nself-assembly, which proved essential for optimizing our synthesis protocols. In addition, we discovered that the rate of protein synthesis was directly proportional to the number of\nfuzzy socks worn by the laboratory personnel, which seemed to modulate the ambient electromagnetic\nfields in the lab and influence the reactivity of the chemical reagents. This finding, though seemingly\nunrelated to the underlying biochemistry, had a profound impact on our experimental design, as we\nlearned to carefully control the sock-related variables to achieve optimal synthesis conditions. The integration of protein synthesis with the principles of Feng Shui also yielded intriguing results, as\nthe strategic placement of laboratory equipment and the arrangement of molecular models according\nto ancient Chinese principles of harmony and balance seemed to enhance the efficiency of the\nsynthesis process. Furthermore, our research revealed a surprising connection between protein synthesis and the art\nof playing the piano, where the intricate patterns of musical composition seemed to mirror the\nfolding pathways of protein molecules. By using protein molecules as building blocks, we were\nable to design and construct complex systems that merged the organic and synthetic worlds, giving\nrise to a new generation of hybrid materials with vast potential for innovation and discovery. The synthesis of proteins under the influence of lunar cycles, desert ant migrations, and fuzzy socks\nled to the creation of novel protein variants with unique properties, which in turn revealed new\ninsights into the intricate relationships between the molecular, the environmental, and the human\nrealms. Furthermore, an investigation into the role of quantum entanglement in the realm of interstellar\ncrochet patterns revealed a fascinating correlation between the stitch count of Andromedian mittens\nand the resonance frequency of platinum-based clarinets. The lemurs\u2019 progress through the obstacle courses was meticulously tracked\nand analyzed, revealing a statistically significant correlation between their navigation speed and the\nresultant protein yield, which was found to be inversely proportional to the number of theremin solos\nperformed during the experiment.

Further analysis of the data revealed a statistically significant correlation between the protein yield and\nthe number of dimples on a standard, regulation-sized golf ball, which was used as a control object in\nthe experiment. This correlation was found to be independent of the gas used, the navigation speed of\nthe lemurs, and the number of theremin solos performed during the experiment, and was therefore\nattributed to an unknown, golf-ball-related factor that was not accounted for in the experimental\ndesign. The results of these experiments were\nintriguing, and revealed a complex, object-dependent pattern of correlations and anti-correlations\nbetween the protein yield and the physical properties of the control object, which will be discussed in\ngreater detail in the following sections.

The pizzas were found to have a profound effect on the protein synthesis process, and were used\nto develop a novel, pizza-based protein synthesis protocol, which utilized the molecular structure\nof the pizza crust to encode the target protein, which was then instantiated through a process of\nquantum-entangled, theremin-mediated, lemur-assisted, fog-dwelling navigation.

        "Abstract": "Improving Model Generalization Using a Single Data\nSample for Semantic Adaptation\nAbstract\nThe limited capacity of deep networks to generalize beyond their training dis-\ntribution presents a significant challenge in semantic segmentation. 2 Related Work\nThis research contributes to the ongoing investigation into the generalization capabilities of semantic\nsegmentation models and is related to explorations of feature normalization and online learning. Here, no such\nannotation is available; the model adjusts to the test sample in an unsupervised manner, without\nrequiring proxy tasks or prior knowledge of the test distribution.",
        "Methodology": "Traditional\napproaches have operated under the assumption of a fixed model post-training,\nwith parameters remaining constant during testing. This research introduces a\nself-adaptive methodology for semantic segmentation that modifies the inference\nmechanism to accommodate each input sample individually. First, it refines the parameters of convolutional\nlayers based on the input image, employing a consistency-based regularization. Second, it modifies the Batch Normalization layers by dynamically blending the\ntraining distribution with a reference distribution extracted from a single test sam-\nple. Although these techniques are individually recognized in the field, their\ncombined application establishes new benchmarks in accuracy for generalization\nfrom synthetic to real-world data. In the generalization scenario considered here, only a single test\nsample is accessible during inference, and no information sharing must occur between subsequent\ntest samples. This study investigates the generalization challenge in semantic segmentation, specifically from\nsynthetic data to real-world scenarios, by employing an adaptive approach. Unlike prior research\nthat has concentrated on modifying model architecture or training procedures, this work revises the\nstandard inference procedure using a technique derived from domain adaptation methods. In addition to these loss-based\nupdates, self-adaptation incorporates feature statistics from the training data with those of the test\nsample within the Batch Normalization layers. .In contrast to previous studies that focused on training strategies and model design, this study\nspecifically examines the inference process during test time. Prior research has attempted to improve\ngeneralization by augmenting synthetic training data with styles transferred from real images, or\nby utilizing a classification model trained on real images to ensure feature proximity between\nmodels via distillation, often seeking layer-specific learning rates. Recent studies have sought to extract\ndomain-invariant feature statistics through instance-selective whitening loss or frequency-based\ndomain randomization. Some techniques involve swapping channel-wise statistics in feature\nnormalization layers and learning adapter functions to adjust the mean and variance based on the\ninput. Another method enforces consistency of output logits across multiple images of the same class. To improve generalization in federated learning, researchers have explored training clients locally\nwith sharpness-aware minimization and averaging stochastic weights. However, these methods either\nassume access to a distribution of real images during training or require modifications to the network\narchitecture. The technique presented in this work does not require either, making it applicable\npost-hoc to already trained models to improve their generalization. The most common methods, including BN, Layer Normalization (LN), and\nInstance Normalization (IN), also impact the model\u2019s expressive capacity, which can be further\nimproved by combining these techniques within a single architecture. Recent work has explored combining source and target statistics during inference,\nweighted by the number of samples they aggregate. Others propose using batch statistics from the\ntarget domain during inference instead of training statistics from the source domain. Conditional generative models have been employed to learn from single image samples for super-\nresolution and scene synthesis. Recently, this principle has been extended to improve the robustness\nof image classification models, though the self-supervised tasks developed for image classification do\nnot always extend well to dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. Recent research has\nproposed more suitable alternatives for self-supervised loss in domain adaptation, and several works\nhave developed domain-specific approaches for medical imaging or first-person vision. In\nthis context, simple objectives like entropy minimization improve baseline accuracy only moderately. In contrast, the self-adaptation method presented here, which uses pseudo-labels to account for\nprediction uncertainty, proves significantly more effective. 3 Methodology\nIn traditional inference, the parameters of the segmentation model are assumed to remain fixed. In\ncontrast, adaptive systems are capable of learning to specialize to their environment. Analogously,\nthis study allows the segmentation model to update its parameters during inference. The proposed approach creates mini-batches of images for each test sample using data augmentation. Starting with the original test image, a set of N augmented images is generated through multi-scaling,\nhorizontal flipping, and grayscaling. These images form a mini-batch that is processed by the CNN. The resulting softmax probabilities are transformed back to the original pixel space using inverse\n2affine transformations, producing multiple predictions for each pixel. The mean of these probabilities\nis computed along the mini-batch dimension for each class and pixel on the spatial grid. A threshold value is computed from the maximum probability of every class to create a class-\ndependent threshold. For each pixel, the class with the highest probability is extracted. Low-\nconfidence predictions are ignored by setting pixels with a softmax probability below the threshold to\nan ignore label, while the remaining pixels use the dominant class as the pseudo-label. This pseudo\nground truth is used to fine-tune the model for a set number of iterations using gradient descent with\nthe cross-entropy loss. The weights are then reset to their initial values before processing the\nnext test sample, ensuring that the model does not accumulate knowledge about the entire target data\ndistribution. Although originally\ndesigned to improve training convergence, it is now recognized for its role in model robustness,\nincluding domain generalization. During training, BN computes the mean and standard deviation\nacross the batch and spatial dimensions. The normalized features are derived using these statistics. At test time, it is common practice to normalize feature values with running estimates of the mean\nand standard deviation across training batches, rather than using test-batch statistics. This study assumes the availability of only a single target sample during inference. Instance Normalization (IN) layers\ncould replace BN layers, but this might lead to covariate shift issues, as sample statistics may only\napproximate the complete test distribution. Additionally, such a replacement could interfere with the\nstatistics of activations in intermediate layers. It combines the inductive bias from\nthe source domain\u2019s running statistics with statistics extracted from a single test instance. The\nsource mean and variance are averaged with sample statistics from the target domain, weighted by\na parameter 1. This parameter represents the shift from the source domain ( 1 = 0) to a reference\ndomain ( 1 = 1). During inference, new mean and variance are computed using this weighted average,\nand these are used to normalize the features of the single test sample. This approach does not affect\nthe behavior of BN layers during training and applies only during testing. 4 Experiments\nIn this study, the evaluation protocol is revised to adhere to principles of robustness and generalization. The supplier has access to two data distributions: the source data for model training and a validation\nset for model validation. The generalization ability of the model is assessed on three distinct target\nsets, providing an estimate of the expected model accuracy for out-of-distribution deployment. Source data for model training comes from two synthetic datasets, GTA and SYNTHIA, which offer\nlow-cost ground truth annotation and exhibit visual discrepancies with real imagery. The average accuracy\nacross these target domains estimates the expected model accuracy. Additionally, the Mapillary\ndataset is used for comparison with previous works, although it does not disclose the geographic\norigins of individual samples. The framework is implemented in PyTorch, and the baseline model is DeepLabv1 without CRF post-\nprocessing. The models are trained on the source domains for 50 epochs using an SGD optimizer with\na learning rate of 0.005, decayed polynomially. The optimal 1 was\ndetermined based on the IoU on the WildDash validation set. Self-\nadaptation outperformed TTA by a clear margin, aligning with reported ECE scores and demonstrating\nthat self-adaptation effectively uses calibrated confidence to generate reliable pseudo-labels. The method outperformed previous methods without modifying the model architecture or training\nprocess, altering only the inference procedure. Self-adaptation can trade off\naccuracy vs. runtime by using fewer update iterations or updating fewer upper network layers. The optimal values were determined using the validation set, and the model\naccuracy declined moderately with deviations from these values. This aligns with the reported ECE scores, demonstrating that self-adaptation effectively\nexploits the calibrated confidence of predictions to yield reliable pseudo-labels. Self-adaptation achieved superior segmentation\naccuracy without requiring access to a distribution of real images for training or modifying the model\narchitecture, unlike previous methods such as ASG, CSG, DRPC, and IBN-Net. The study also compared self-adaptation with Tent, which updates model parameters at test time\nby minimizing entropy. Further analysis revealed that self-adaptation provides a flexible mechanism for trading off accuracy\nand runtime by varying the number of update iterations and the layers to adjust. To address this, a self-adaptive inference process was introduced, bypassing the need\nfor explicit assumptions about the test distribution. This study also outlined four principles for a\nrigorous evaluation process in domain generalization, adhering to best practices in machine learning\nresearch. While the presented self-adaptation method is not yet real-time, it offers a favorable trade-off between\naccuracy and computational cost compared to model ensembles. Future research could explore\nreducing the latency of self-adaptive inference through adaptive step sizes, higher-order optimization,\nor low-precision computations. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of self-adaptation to\nenhance model generalization and robustness in various applications.",
        "Results and Findings": "This adaptation in-\nvolves two principal operations. The empirical evidence from this study indicates\nthat self-adaptation can effectively enhance deep network generalization to out-\nof-domain data, serving as a valuable complement to the established methods of\nmodel regularization during training. In domain adaptation, some\nstudies use source-domain statistics during training and replace them with target-domain statistics\nduring inference. Domain adaptation methods often mitigate this issue by replacing source running statistics with those\nof the target, a technique known as Adaptive Batch Normalization (AdaBN). Experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of the parameter 1 in Self-adaptive Nor-\nmalization (SaN) on segmentation accuracy and the Intersection over Union (IoU) for both source\ndomains (GTA, SYNTHIA) and all main target domains (Cityscapes, BDD, IDD). The segmentation accuracy with this\noptimal 1 was reported, showing that SaN improves the mean IoU over both the established t-BN\nbaseline and the more recent p-BN. The improvement was consistent across different backbone archi-\ntectures and target domains. Additionally, model calibration, measured by the expected calibration\nerror (ECE), was found to improve with SaN, which was competitive with the MC-Dropout method\nand showed complementary effects when used jointly. Self-adaptation was compared with state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, showing consis-\ntent improvements over carefully tuned baselines, regardless of backbone architecture or source data. A comparison with Tent, which also updates model parameters at test time but minimizes entropy\ninstead of using pseudo-labels, showed that self-adaptation outperformed Tent substantially. This\nwas demonstrated by training HRNet-W18 on GTA and comparing the IoU on Cityscapes, where\nself-adaptation achieved a 7.5% improvement in IoU. The influence of the number of iterations for self-adaptation was investigated, showing that self-\nadaptation balances accuracy and inference time by adjusting iteration numbers and layer choices. It was found to be more efficient and accurate than model ensembles. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis revealed that self-adaptation is robust to the choice of hyperpa-\nrameters 1, 8, and 7. Qualitative results showed that\nself-adaptation improves segmentation quality and reduces pathological failure modes. The integration of self-adaptation with state-of-the-art architectures like DeepLabv3+, HRNet-W18,\nHRNet-W48, and UPerNet with a Swin-T backbone demonstrated substantial improvements in\nsegmentation accuracy across all target domains. Evaluation on the ACDC dataset, which includes\nadverse weather conditions, showed that self-adaptation outperformed the baseline by 13.57% on\naverage. However,\nthese failure cases were relatively rare, and the majority of image samples benefited from self-\nadaptation, with accuracy improvements of up to 35% IoU compared to the baseline. 5 Results\nThe empirical results demonstrate that self-adaptive normalization (SaN) consistently enhances\nsegmentation accuracy in out-of-distribution scenarios. For instance, when training on the GTA\ndataset and testing on Cityscapes, BDD, and IDD, SaN improved the mean IoU by 4.1% with ResNet-\n50 and 5.1% with ResNet-101 compared to the t-BN baseline. Furthermore, SaN outperformed the\nmore recent p-BN method, showing improvements irrespective of the backbone architecture and\nthe target domain tested. In terms of calibration quality, measured by the expected calibration error\n(ECE), SaN not only improved the baseline but also showed competitiveness with the MC-Dropout\nmethod, even exhibiting complementary effects when both methods were combined. Self-adaptation was found to outperform traditional Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) across both\nsource domains (GTA, SYNTHIA) and three target domains (Cityscapes, BDD, IDD). Despite TTA\nimproving the baseline, self-adaptation provided a clear and consistent margin of 2.19% IoU on\n4average. In comparison to state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, self-adaptation showed substantial\nimprovements even over carefully tuned baselines. It outperformed methods like DRPC and FSDR\non most benchmarks, despite these methods using individual models for each target domain and\nresorting to target domains for hyperparameter tuning. Specifically, when training HRNet-W18 on GTA and\nevaluating on Cityscapes, self-adaptation achieved a 7.5% improvement in IoU compared to Tent\nunder a comparable computational budget. It was found to be\nmore efficient and accurate than model ensembles. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis indicated that\nself-adaptation is robust to the choice of hyperparameters, with optimal values determined using the\nvalidation set. Qualitative results demonstrated that self-adaptation visibly improves segmentation quality, reducing\nartifacts and mislabeling compared to the baseline. The method\u2019s effectiveness was consistent across\ndifferent architectures, including DeepLabv3+, HRNet-W18, HRNet-W48, and UPerNet with a\nSwin-T backbone, showing substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy on all target domains. The analysis demonstrated that even a single sample from the test domain can significantly improve\nmodel predictions. The self-adaptive approach showed substantial accuracy improvements without\naltering the training process or model architecture, unlike previous works. These results suggest\nthat self-adaptive techniques could be valuable in other application domains, such as panoptic\nsegmentation or monocular depth prediction.",
        "Conclusion": "This study\ncomplements these findings by demonstrating improved generalization of semantic segmentation\nmodels. After this self-adaptation process, a single final prediction is produced using\nthe updated model weights. 6 Conclusion\nThe traditional learning principle of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) assumes independent and\nidentically distributed training and testing data, which often results in models that are not robust to\ndomain shifts. 5"

        "Abstract": "Interpreting Recurrent and Attention-Based Neural\nModels: a Case Study on Natural Language Inference\nAbstract\nDeep learning models have achieved remarkable success in natural language in-\nference (NLI) tasks.",
        "Methodology": "While these models are widely explored, they are hard to\ninterpret and it is often unclear how and why they actually work. we propose to interpret the intermediate layers\nof NLI models by visualizing the saliency of attention and LSTM gating signals. However, unlike traditional\nmethods that provide optimized weights for human understandable features, the behavior of deep\nlearning models is much harder to interpret. Due to the high dimensionality of word embeddings, and\nthe complex, typically recurrent architectures used for textual data, it is often unclear how and why a\ndeep learning model reaches its decisions. There are a few attempts toward explaining/interpreting deep learning-based models, mostly by\nvisualizing the representation of words and/or hidden states, and their importances (via saliency or\nerasure) on shallow tasks like sentiment analysis and POS tagging. we extend this concept to the intermediate layer of deep models to\nexamine the saliency of attention as well as the LSTM gating signals to understand the behavior of\nthese components and their impact on the final decision. First, we introduce new strategies for interpreting the behavior of\ndeep models in their intermediate layers, specifically, by examining the saliency of the attention and\nthe gating signals. Second, we provide an extensive analysis of the state-of-the-art model for the NLI\ntask and show that our methods reveal interesting insights not available from traditional methods of\ninspecting attention and word saliency. Furthermore, the state-of- the-art NLI models employ complex neural architectures\ninvolving key mechanisms, such as attention and repeated reading, widely seen in successful models\nfor other NLP tasks. As such, we expect our methods to be potentially useful for other natural\nunderstanding tasks as well. ESIM reads the sentences independently using LSTM at first, and then applies attention to\nalign/contrast the sentences. Another round of LSTM reading then produces the final representations,\nwhich are compared to make the prediction. we focus on the attention and\nthe gating signals of LSTM readers, and how they contribute to the decisions of the model. Several pieces of prior work in NLI have attempted to visualize\nthe attention layer to provide some understanding of their models. Such visualizations generate a\nheatmap representing the similarity between the hidden states of the premise and the hypothesis. Unfortunately the similarities are often the same regardless of the decision. Let us consider the following example, where the same premise \u201cA kid is playing in the garden\u201d, is\npaired with three different hypotheses:\nh1: A kid is taking a nap in the garden\nh2: A kid is having fun in the garden with her family\nh3: A kid is having fun in the garden\nNote that the ground truth relationships are Contradiction, Neutral, and Entailment, respectively. The key issue is that the attention visualization only allows us to see how the model aligns the premise\nwith the hypothesis, but does not show how such alignment impacts the decision. Specifically, given a premise-hypothesis pair and\nthe model\u2019s decision y, we consider the similarity between a pair of premise and hypothesis hidden\nstates eij as a variable. The score of the decision S(y) is thus a function of eij for all i and j. The\nsaliency of eij is then defined to be |S(y) / eij|. For h2, the alignment of \u201ckid\u201d and \u201cher family\u201d seems to be the most salient for the decision of\nNeutral. From this example, we can see that by inspecting the attention saliency, we effectively pinpoint which\npart of the alignments contribute most critically to the final prediction whereas simply visualizing the\nattention itself reveals little information. Now we use\nthe attention saliency to compare the two different ESIM models: ESIM-50 and ESIM-300. Although the two models make different predictions, their attention maps appear qualitatively similar. The saliency map, however, reveals that the two models use these values quite differently, with only\nESIM-300 correctly focusing on them. In other words, they indicate how LSTM\nreads the word sequences and how the information from different parts is captured and combined. we consider both the gating signals and their saliency, which is computed as the partial derivative of\nthe score of the final decision with respect to each gating signal. Instead of considering individual dimensions of the gating signals, we aggregate them to consider\ntheir norm, both for the signal and for its saliency. Note that ESIM models have two LSTM layers,\nthe first (input) LSTM performs the input encoding and the second (inference) LSTM generates the\nrepresentation for inference. , we first note that the saliency tends to be somewhat consistent across different gates within the same\nLSTM, suggesting that we can interpret them jointly to identify parts of the sentence important for\nthe model\u2019s prediction. Comparing across examples, we see that the saliency curves show pronounced differences across the\nexamples. The focus\n(evidenced by its strong saliency and strong gating signal) on this particular part, which presents\ninformation not available from the premise, explains the model\u2019s decision of Neutral. Comparing the behavior of the input LSTM and the inference LSTM, we observe interesting shifts\nof focus. the inference LSTM tends to see much more concentrated saliency over key parts of the\nsentence, whereas the input LSTM sees more spread of saliency. Note that ESIM uses\nattention between the input and inference LSTM layers to align/contrast the sentences, hence it makes\nsense that the inference LSTM is more focused on the critical differences between the sentences. It is worth noting that, while revealing similar general trends, the backward LSTM can sometimes\nfocus on different parts of the sentence, suggesting the forward and backward readings provide\ncomplementary understanding of the sentence. Our strategies are able to provide interesting insights not achievable by previous explanation\ntechniques. We divide ESIM to three main parts: 1) input encoding,\n2) attention, and 3) inference. Let u = [u1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, un] and v = [v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, vm] be the given premise with length n and hypothesis with\nlength m respectively, where ui, vj Rr are word embeddings of r-dimensional vector. The goal is to\npredict a label y that indicates the logical relationship between premise u and hypothesis v. Below we\nbriefly explain the aforementioned parts. (1) u^ = BiLSTM(u)\n(2) v^ = BiLSTM(v)\nwhere u^ Rn\u00d72d and v^ Rm\u00d72d are the reading sequences of u and v respectively. 5.1.2 Attention\nIt employs a soft alignment method to associate the relevant sub-components between the given\npremise and hypothesis. Equation 3 (energy function) computes the unnormalized attention weights\nas the similarity of hidden states of the premise and hypothesis. Next, for each word in either premise or hypothesis, the relevant semantics in\nthe other sentence is extracted and composed according to eij. Equations 4 and 5 provide formal and\nspecific details of this procedure. (4) u~i = sum(exp(eij) / sum(exp(eik))) * uj, i [1, n]\n(5) v~j = sum(exp(eij) / sum(exp(ekj))) * ui, j [1, m]\nwhere u~i represents the extracted relevant information of v^ by attending to u^i while v~j represents\nthe extracted relevant information of u^ by attending to v^j. Equations 6 and 7 formally\nrepresent this process. p and q indicate the output of attention de- vision for\npremise and hypothesis respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Real-Time Adaptation of Lexical Embeddings for\nEnhanced Part-of-Speech Tagging\nAbstract\nThis research introduces a method for real-time unsupervised domain adaptation\n(DA) that can be applied incrementally as new information arrives. The ith element xi of the left distributional vector for a word w is the\nweighted count of times the indicator word ci appears immediately to the left of w:\nxi=tf(freq(bigram (ci, w))) (1)\nwhere ci is the word with frequency rank i in the corpus, freq(bigram(ci, w)) is the occurrence count\nof the bigram \"ci w\", and non-zero frequencies are weighted logarithmically: tf(x) = 1 + log(x). When examining individual conditions, ONLINE generally outperforms STATIC, showing better\nresults in 10 out of 12 cases and only slightly underperforming in the l:small/u:big condition for\nunseens and known words (0.1086 vs. 0.1084, 0.0802 vs. 0.0801). For space reasons, we do not discuss supervised domain adaptation.",
        "Methodology": "This method is\nespecially useful when conventional batch DA is unfeasible. This situation typically arises when labeled\ndata is available for a source domain, but there is a need to enhance performance in a target domain\nusing only unlabeled data. A majority of the current NLP research on unsupervised domain adaptation\nemploys batch learning, which presumes the availability of a substantial corpus of unlabeled data\nfrom the target domain before the testing phase. However, batch learning is impractical in numerous\nreal-world situations where data from a new target domain must be processed without delay. This stream evolves over time without any explicit signals indicating that the\ncurrent models should be adjusted to the new data distribution. Given that the system is expected to\noperate in real-time, it would be beneficial for any system adaptation to be done in an online manner,\nas opposed to the batch method, which involves halting the system, modifying it, and then restarting\nit. This paper introduces real-time unsupervised domain adaptation as an enhancement to conventional\nunsupervised DA. In this approach, domain adaptation is carried out incrementally as data is received. Specifically, our implementation involves a type of representation learning, where the focus is on\nupdating word representations in our experiments. To our understanding, the research presented here is the first to examine real-time unsupervised\nDA. In particular, we assess this method for POS tagging tasks. We analyze POS tagging outcomes\nusing three different methods: a static baseline, batch learning, and real-time unsupervised DA. This tagger approaches POS tagging as a multi-label\nclassification problem within a window-based framework, rather than a sequence classification\none. FLORS is well-suited for real-time unsupervised DA because its word representations includedistributional vectors, which can be updated during both batch learning and real-time unsupervised\nDA. Suffix and shape features are\nstandard in the literature, and we utilize them as described previously. The\nright distributional vector is defined similarly. We limit the set of indicator words to the 500 most\nfrequent. FLORS operates under the assumption that the fundamental relationship between distributional\nfeatures and labels remains consistent when transitioning from the source to the target domain. This\ncontrasts with other studies that select \"stable\" distributional features and discard \"unstable\" ones. Our evaluation utilizes the development sets from six different target domains (TDs):\nfive SANCL domains (newsgroups, weblogs, reviews, answers, emails) and sections 22-23 of the\nWall Street Journal (WSJ) for in-domain testing. Two training sets of varying sizes are employed. In the l:big condition (large labeled data set), FLORS\nis trained on sections 2-21 of the WSJ. The l:small condition uses 10% of the l:big data set. We also adjust the size of the datasets used for computing word\nrepresentations before training the FLORS model. In the u:big condition, distributional vectors are\ncomputed on the combined corpus of all labeled and unlabeled text from both source and target\ndomains (excluding test sets), along with 100,000 WSJ sentences from 1988 and 500,000 sentences\nfrom a large external corpus. In the u:0 condition, only labeled training data is utilized. Methods. We implemented a modification from the original setup: distributional vectors are stored\nin memory as count vectors, enabling count increases during online tagging. Experiments are conducted with three versions of FLORS: STATIC, BATCH, and ONLINE. All three\nmethods compute word representations on \"data for word representations\" before model training on\none of the two \"training sets\". Word representations remain unchanged during testing. Before testing, count vectors are updated by freq(bigram(ci, w)) += freq*(bigram(ci, w)),\nwhere freq*( \u02d800b7) denotes the bigram \"ci w\" occurrences in the entire test set. Before tagging a test sentence, both left and right distributional vectors are updated via\nfreq(bigram(ci, w)) += 1 for each \"ci w\" bigram appearance in the sentence. The sentence is then\ntagged using the updated word representations. As tagging progresses, distributional representations\nbecome increasingly specific to the target domain (TD), converging to the representations that BATCH\nuses at the end of the tagging process. 2In all three modes, suffix and shape features are always fully specified, for both known and unknown\nwords. It also demonstrates that\nperformance improves with an increase in both training data and unlabeled data. The performance of ONLINE is similar to that of BATCH. It is slightly lower than BATCH in the\nu:0 condition, with the most significant difference in accuracy being 0.29, and it is at most 0.02\ndifferent from BATCH in terms of overall accuracy in the u:big condition. To analyze the progression of these changes over time, a substantial application domain is necessary\nbecause subtle changes might be too inconsistent in the smaller test sets of the SANCL TDs. Consequently, we\ninvert the usual setup by training the model on the development sets of the five SANCL domains\n(l:big) or on the initial 5000 labeled words of reviews (l:small). In this reversed setup, u:big utilizes\nthe five unlabeled SANCL datasets along with a large external corpus as before. 3Table 2: ONLINE / BATCH accuracies are generally better than STATIC (see bold numbers) and\nimprove with both more training data and more unlabeled data. !u:0 u:big\nALL KN SHFT OOV ALL KN SHFT OOV\nl:small STATIC 87.02 90.87 71.12 57.16 89.02 91.48 81.53 58.30\nONLINE 87.99 90.87 76.10 65.64 89.84 92.38 82.58 67.09\nnewsgroups l:big BATCH 88.28 91.08 77.01 66.37 89.82 92.37 82.65 67.03\nSTATIC 89.69 93.00 82.65 57.82 89.93 92.41 84.94 58.97\nONLINE 90.51 93.13 82.51 67.57 90.85 93.04 84.94 71.00\nBATCH 90.69 93.12 83.24 69.43 90.87 93.03 85.20 71.18\nl:small STATIC 89.08 91.96 66.55 65.90 91.45 92.47 80.11 70.81\nONLINE 89.67 92.14 70.14 69.67 92.11 93.62 81.46 78.42\nreviews l:big BATCH 89.79 92.23 69.86 71.27 92.10 93.60 81.51 78.42\nSTATIC 91.96 93.94 82.30 67.97 92.42 93.53 84.65 69.97\nONLINE 92.33 94.03 83.59 72.50 93.07 94.36 85.71 79.03\nBATCH 92.42 94.09 83.53 73.35 93.07 94.36 85.71 79.03\nl:small STATIC 91.58 94.29 79.95 72.74 93.42 94.77 89.80 77.42\nONLINE 92.51 94.52 81.76 80.46 94.21 95.40 91.08 84.03\nweblogs l:big BATCH 92.68 94.60 82.34 81.20 94.20 95.42 91.03 83.87\nSTATIC 93.45 95.64 90.15 72.68 94.09 95.54 91.90 76.94\nONLINE 94.18 95.82 89.80 80.35 94.86 95.81 92.60 86.53\nBATCH 94.34 95.85 90.03 81.84 94.86 95.82 92.60 86.53\nl:small STATIC 86.93 90.89 66.51 53.43 88.98 91.09 77.63 57.36\nONLINE 87.48 91.18 68.07 56.47 89.71 92.42 78.11 64.21\nanswers l:big BATCH 87.56 91.11 68.25 58.44 89.71 92.43 78.23 64.09\nSTATIC 89.54 92.76 78.65 56.22 90.06 92.18 80.70 58.25\nONLINE 89.98 92.97 79.07 59.77 90.68 93.21 81.48 65.16\nBATCH 90.14 93.10 79.01 60.72 90.70 93.22 81.54 65.29\nl:small STATIC 85.43 90.85 57.85 51.65 87.76 90.35 70.86 56.76\nONLINE 86.30 91.26 60.56 55.83 88.45 92.31 71.67 61.57\nemails l:big BATCH 86.42 91.31 61.03 56.32 88.46 92.32 71.71 61.65\nSTATIC 88.31 92.98 71.38 52.71 89.21 91.74 73.80 58.99\nONLINE 88.86 93.08 72.38 57.78 89.85 93.30 75.32 65.48\nBATCH 88.96 93.11 72.28 58.85 89.84 93.30 75.27 65.44\nl:small STATIC 94.64 95.44 83.38 82.72 95.73 95.88 90.36 87.87\nONLINE 94.86 95.53 85.37 85.22 95.80 96.21 89.89 89.70\nwsj l:big BATCH 94.80 95.46 85.51 85.38 95.80 96.22 89.89 89.70\nSTATIC 96.44 96.85 92.75 85.38 96.56 96.72 93.35 88.04\nONLINE 96.50 96.85 93.55 86.38 96.62 96.89 93.35 91.69\nBATCH 96.57 96.82 93.48 86.54 96.63 96.89 93.42 91.86\nTable 3 also includes data on \"unseens\" along with unknowns, as prior research indicates that unseens\nlead to at least as many errors as unknowns.

        "Abstract": "Specialized Neural Network for Extracting Financial Trading Signals:\nThe Alpha Discovery Neural Network\nAbstract\nGenetic programming (GP) is currently the leading method for automated feature generation in financial applica-\ntions. This\ngeneral and simple setting is enough to beat the GP. For Le-net and Resnet, they don\u2019t provide us with more informative features. ADNN\u2019s diversity is larger than the GP, but\nfor further research, making ADNN\u2019s diversity even larger is still badly needed.",
        "Methodology": "It utilizes reverse Polish notation to denote features and subsequently performs an evolutionary procedure. Nevertheless, with the advancements in deep learning, more effective feature extraction instruments have become\naccessible. This research introduces the Alpha Discovery Neural Network (ADNN), a customized neural network\narchitecture designed to autonomously generate a variety of financial technical indicators using established\nknowledge. Secondly, we substitute genetic programming\nwith pre-training and model pruning techniques to enable a more streamlined evolutionary process. Numerous\nfactors, including historical price, volume, and a company\u2019s financial information, can be employed to forecast the future returns of\nstocks. Various well-known multi-factor models have been introduced to\naddress this task, and numerous established technical and fundamental factors have been developed. Subsequently, the Fama-French Five-Factor Model and numerous other factors have been formulated by domain experts. Secondly, humans are unable to create certain nonlinear\nfeatures from data with high dimensionality. During this operation, new features can be created by combining pre-existing features. Occasionally,\nfeature construction and feature selection can be integrated into a single process. These methodologies encompass wrapper, filtering,\nand embedded techniques. The wrapper method exhibits strong performance\nby directly utilizing the model\u2019s outcomes as an objective function. Consequently, it can treat an independently trained model as\na newly generated feature. Nevertheless, a substantial quantity of computational resources and time are necessary. 2 Related Work\nWith the progression of deep learning, an increasing number of researchers are utilizing neural networks to derive features from raw\ndata and subsequently incorporating a fully connected layer to modify the feature\u2019s output. Similarly, a trained model signifies a\nnewly developed feature. Researchers have leveraged it on pattern recognition tasks, employing a CNN model to construct facial\ndescriptors, and this method generates features that possess considerably more information than the previous method. Recurrent neural networks have\nbeen used to pre-locate feature-rich regions and successfully construct more refined features. In a text classification task, recurrent\nneural networks have been utilized to build a rule-based classifier among text data, wherein each classifier represents a portion\nof the text. A network structure that uses both a recurrent neural network and a convolutional neural network to extract text\ninformation has been proposed. In financial feature engineering tasks, researchers have commenced\nemploying neural networks to provide an embedding representation of financial time series. More specifically, LSTM has been\nutilized to embed various stock time series, followed by adversarial training to perform binary classification on a stock\u2019s future\nreturn. This embedding can more effectively represent\nthe varying affinities across technical indicators. Adopting a similar concept, we employ a neural network to provide a concise\nembedding of extended financial time series. 3 Methodology\nThe ADNN\u2019s network architecture is structured in a specific way. The primary contributions of this innovative network structure are:\n1) ADNN employs Spearman Correlation as its loss function, mirroring the practices of human quantitative investment. Furthermore,\nthe sampling guidelines adhere to economic principles. 2) A significant, derivable kennel function is introduced as a substitute for\nthe non-derivable operator. 3) We utilize pre-training and pruning in place of the GP\u2019s evolutionary process, resulting in enhanced\nefficiency. In each back-propagation cycle, ADNN randomly selects data from a certain number of trading days and subsequently computes the\nSpearman Coefficient between the factor value and factor return for each of those days. The number of days should be greater than 3,\nand incorporating information from multiple trading days enables the neural network to achieve a more consistent convergence. Quantitative investors prioritize the relative strength of each stock on a given trading day over its absolute strength. Therefore,\nperforming calculations for each trading day and employing the Spearman Coefficient as the loss function is justifiable. We posit that there are a certain number of stocks pertaining to a given trading day in each batch. The input tensor has a specific\nshape because there are a certain number of samples, and five categories of time series: the opening price, high price, low price,\nclosing price, and volume. Each time series has an input length. We also designate the output tensor as the factor value, possessing a\nparticular shape. The factor return tensor has a specific shape, denoting the profit we can obtain from this asset over an extended\nduration. The holding period\u2019s length is defined. The raw data is standardized using its time-series mean and standard deviation\nderived from the training set. Both the mean and standard deviation are computed from the training set. We endeavor to employ\nthese inputs to forecast the stock return for the subsequent 5 trading days (utilizing 3-15 trading days is advisable). For each experiment, 250 trading days\nconstitute the training set, the ensuing 30 trading days serve as the validation set, and the subsequent 90 trading days function as the\ntesting set. The generated factors maintain a high Information Coefficient (IC) throughout the subsequent 90 trading days. Most\nsignificantly, we emphasize a counter-intuitive configuration: the training period should not surpass 250 trading days due to the\nnon-stationary nature of financial features. If we mandate a feature to function effectively over an extended duration, we will only\nencounter this feature in an over-fitting scenario. Consequently, we devise a rolling forecast framework wherein we automatically\nidentify potent features for each trading day. Each autonomously generated feature will have its own period of prominence on that\nparticular trading day. Moreover, these factors not only perform effectively on this single day but also maintain their efficacy for\nseveral trading days, exhibiting a gradual decline. To ensure an equitable comparison, the identical configuration is implemented for the GP algorithm. The logic of this algorithm\nreferences related work. Moreover, the input data\u2019s period and type must be consistent. In this paper, we scrutinize the performance\nof the constructed features from diverse angles. In order to show the general situation, we equip ADNN\nwith 4 fully-connected layers. Each layer has 128 neural, tanh activate function, L2 Regularization, and dropout technic. We put forward three schemes help to show how ADNN beat the GP. Only GP\nmeans only using genetic programming, Only ADNN means only use ADNN to construct factors, GP&ADNN means use GP\u2019s\nvalue to initialize ADNN and then construct factors. All the experiments are conducted out of the sample. Similar to the conculsions made above, if we combine these two methods together, the combined\nfactors\u2019 strategy has the best performance in backtesting. Table 3 shows that, basically, all neural networks can produce more diversified features than using GP. But temporal extractors are\nespecially better at producing diversified features, such as LSTM and Transformer. TCN relies\non a convolution neural network, but LSTM and Transformer still contain recurrent neural networks (Normally, the transformer\nuses a recurrent neural network to embedded the input data). Our objective is to ascertain whether ADNN can enhance the factor pool and improve upon the traditional multi-factor\nstrategy. We establish a commonly employed multi-factor strategy to assess its performance in a real-world context. Within the training set,\nsamples whose returns rank in the top 30% for each trading day are designated as 1, while those ranking in the bottom 30% are\nlabeled as 0. The remaining samples in the training set are discarded. Following the training of these features using XGBoost in\n3binary logistics mode, the prediction outcome reflects the probability of a stock exhibiting exceptional performance in the subsequent\n5 trading days. It designates the 50 features constructed by human experts as PK 50, the features constructed by ADNN as New 50,\nand the features constructed by both GP and PK as GP-PK 50. In separate experiments, we use XGBoost to pre-train both PK 50\nand New 50 in the training set and then using the weight score from XGBoost to choose the 50 most important features as Combined\n50. Table 4: Back testing starts from Jan 2019 to June 2019. The max drawdown is the worst loss of the excess return from its peak. These indicators can show the strategy\u2019s\nperformance from the perspective of both return and risk. For the New 50, although they have higher IC than the PK 50, their overall performance is not always better than PK 50. Thus, although every single\nnew factor is better than the old factor, their overall performance not always be better. In the real world use case, all investors have their\nown reliable and secret factor pool, what they want is that the new constructed factors can bring in margin benefits. Thus, they will\nuse both new and old factors to do trading. We have meticulously crafted its network architecture in accordance with economic principles and furnished\nit with a variety of sophisticated feature extractors. Empirical results indicate that ADNN can generate features that are more\ninformative and diverse than those produced by the benchmark method in this specific application. We have conducted numerous experiments to validate this observation and endeavor to\ncomprehend its functionality. For future research, we intend to employ this framework to automatically generate valuable features\nbased on companies\u2019 fundamental data and sentiment data.",
        "Results and Findings": "Our primary contributions are threefold. Thirdly, the\nfeature extraction components within ADNN can be interchanged with various other feature extractors, resulting\nin the creation of diverse functions. Empirical findings demonstrate that ADNN can produce more distinct and\ninformative features in comparison to GP, thereby effectively augmenting the existing pool of factors. Fully\nconnected and recurrent networks demonstrate superior performance in extracting information from financial\ntime series compared to convolutional neural networks. In practical scenarios, the features generated by ADNN\nconsistently enhance the revenue, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown of multi-factor strategies when contrasted\nwith investment strategies that do not incorporate these factors. Experimentshave been conducted on this task, employing a deeper and wider convolutional neural network. Utilizing a neural network\u2019s robust fitting capability, we can generate highly informative features by\ncustomizing the network architecture for diverse industries. Well-designed LSTM has been adopted to extract features from unstructured news data, subsequently forming a continuous\nembedding. The experimental outcomes indicate that these unstructured data can furnish substantial information and are highly\nbeneficial for event-driven trading. In the experimental section, we will present the experimental\noutcomes based on more intricate and varied feature extractors. Extensive experiments have been performed to identify appropriate hyper-parameters. 25 Results\nThe network structure can equip ADNN with different deep neural networks.

        "Conclusion": "And we also find that\nGP&ADNN is the best, it means that our method can even improve the performance of GP. It shows that ADNN has also\nbeaten the SOTA in real practice.

        "Abstract": "3D Food Modeling from Images: Advancements in\nPhysically-Aware Reconstruction\nAbstract\nThe growing focus on computer vision for applications in nutritional monitoring\nand dietary tracking has spurred the creation of sophisticated 3D reconstruction\nmethods for various food items. 4.1.3 Detecting the scaling factor\nGenerally, 3D reconstruction methods generate unitless meshes (i.e., no physical scale) by default.",
        "Methodology": "A lack of high-quality data, combined with\ninsufficient collaboration between academic research and industry applications,\nhas hindered advancements in this area. This paper outlines a comprehensive\nworkshop and challenge centered on physically informed 3D food reconstruction,\nleveraging recent progress in 3D reconstruction technologies. Participants were\nassigned the task of building 3D models for 20 distinct food items, each presenting\nvarying degrees of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. The easy category offers\n200 images, the medium provides 30, and the hard level includes only a single\nimage to facilitate the reconstruction process. The methodologies developed during this challenge\nhave yielded encouraging outcomes in 3D food reconstruction, demonstrating\nconsiderable potential for enhancing portion estimation in dietary evaluations and\nnutritional tracking. This initiative aims to close the divide between current methodologies and practical needs by\nconcentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food items from multi-view and single-\nview image data. The challenge promotes the creation of novel methods capable of managing the\nintricacies of food forms, textures, and variations in lighting, all while adhering to the practical\nlimitations inherent in real-world dietary assessment situations. Conventional methods for diet assessment, like 24-Hour Recall or Food Frequency Questionnaires\n(FFQ), frequently depend on manual data entry, which can be imprecise and difficult to manage. Additionally, the lack of 3D data in 2D RGB food images poses significant hurdles for methods\nthat rely on regression to estimate food portions directly from images of eating occasions. Participants were tasked with creating 3D models of 20 different food items from 2D images,\nsimulating a scenario where a smartphone equipped with a depth-sensing camera is employed for\ndietary recording and nutritional oversight. The challenge was divided into three levels of complexity:\n.The easy level provided approximately 200 frames uniformly sampled from a video, the medium level\noffered about 30 images, and the hard level presented participants with just one monocular top-view\nimage. This arrangement was intended to assess the resilience and adaptability of the suggested\nsolutions under various real-world conditions. 2 Related Work\nEstimating food portions is a crucial part of image-based dietary assessment, with the objective of\ndetermining the volume, energy content, or macronutrient breakdown directly from images of meals. Specifically, accurately estimating portion\nsizes requires an understanding of the volume and density of the food, aspects that cannot be easily\ndetermined from a two-dimensional image, which highlights the need for advanced methodologies\nand technologies to address this issue. Current methods for estimating food portions are classified\ninto four primary categories. Stereo-Based Approaches. These techniques depend on multiple frames to deduce the 3D con-\nfiguration of food items. For instance, some methods calculate food volume through multi-view\nstereo reconstruction based on epipolar geometry, while others use a two-view dense reconstruction\napproach. However, the need for multiple images limits the\npracticality of these methods in real-world situations. Model-Based Approach. This approach uses predefined shapes and templates to estimate the target\nvolume. Some methods assign specific templates to foods from a reference set and make adjustments\nbased on physical cues to gauge the size and position of the food. A similar approach that matches\ntemplates is employed to estimate food volume from just one image. However, these methods struggle\nto accommodate foods with shapes that do not conform to the established templates. Depth Camera-Based Approach. This method utilizes depth cameras to create maps that indicate\nthe distance from the camera to the food in the picture. The depth map is then used to create a voxel\nrepresentation of the image, which aids in estimating the food\u2019s volume. Deep Learning Approach. Some use regression networks\nto estimate the caloric value of food from a single image or from an \"Energy Distribution Map\" that\ncorrelates the input image with the energy distribution of the foods shown. Others use regression\nnetworks trained on images and depth maps to deduce the energy, mass, and macronutrients of the\nfood in the image. These methods require extensive data for training and are generally not transparent. Despite the progress these methods have made in estimating food portions, they each have limitations\nthat restrict their broad use and precision in practical scenarios. Methods based on stereo are not\nsuitable for single-image inputs, those based on models have difficulty with a variety of food shapes,\napproaches using depth cameras necessitate specialized equipment, and deep learning methods are not\neasily interpretable and have difficulty with samples that are different from those they were trained on. To ensure the reconstructed 3D\nmodels accurately represent size, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern\nmat, which provide a physical reference for scaling. The challenge is segmented into three levels of\ndifficulty, based on the number of 2D images provided for reconstruction:\n\u2022 Easy: Roughly 200 images taken from video. 3.2.1 Phase-I: Volume Accuracy\nIn the first phase, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used as the metric to evaluate the\naccuracy of portion size. The calculation for MAPE is as follows:\nMAPE =1\nnnX\ni=1\f\f\f\fAi\u2212Fi\nAi\f\f\f\f\u00d7100%\nwhere Airepresents the actual volume (in milliliters) of the i-th food item, as determined from the\nscanned 3D mesh, and Fiis the volume calculated from the reconstructed 3D mesh. This\nphase includes multiple steps to guarantee both accuracy and fairness:\n1.Model Verification : Submitted models are checked against the final submissions from\nPhase-I to ensure they are consistent. Visual inspections are also conducted to prevent any\nviolations of the rules, such as submitting basic shapes (like spheres) rather than detailed\nreconstructions. They must align their models with these true models\nand create a transformation matrix for each item submitted. The ultimate Chamfer distance\nscore is then calculated using the submitted models and their corresponding transformation\nmatrices. 3.Chamfer Distance Calculation : The accuracy of the shape is assessed using the Chamfer\ndistance. For two sets of points, XandY, the Chamfer distance is computed as follows:\ndCD(X, Y ) =1\n|X|X\nx\u2208Xmin\ny\u2208Y\u2225x\u2212y\u22252\n2+1\n|Y|X\ny\u2208Ymin\nx\u2208X\u2225x\u2212y\u22252\n2\nThis metric offers a thorough assessment of how closely the reconstructed 3D models match the\nactual models. The ultimate ranking is determined by merging the scores from both Phase-I (accuracy\nof volume) and Phase-II (accuracy of shape). 4 First Place Team - VolETA\n4.1 Methodology\nThe team\u2019s research employs multi-view reconstruction to generate detailed food meshes and accu-\nrately determine food volumes. 4.1.1 Overview\nThe team\u2019s method integrates computer vision and deep learning to accurately estimate food volume\nfrom RGBD images and masks. Keyframe selection, supported by perceptual hashing and blur\ndetection, ensures data quality. The estimation of camera poses and object segmentation establishes\nthe basis for neural surface reconstruction, resulting in detailed meshes for volume estimation. Refinement processes, such as removing isolated parts and adjusting the scaling factor, improve\naccuracy. 4.1.2 The Team\u2019s Proposal: VolETA\nThe team starts their process by obtaining input data, specifically RGBD images and their correspond-\ning food object masks. These RGBD images are denoted as ID={ID\ni}n\ni=1, where nis the total\nnumber of frames, providing the necessary depth information alongside the RGB images. Next, the team proceeds with keyframe selection. From the set {ID\ni}n\ni=1, keyframes {IK\nj}k\nj=1\u2286\n{ID\ni}n\ni=1are selected. The team implements a method to detect and remove duplicates and blurry\nimages to ensure high-quality frames. This involves applying the Gaussian blurring kernel followed\nby the fast Fourier transform method. Near-Image Similarity employs a perceptual hashing and\nhamming distance thresholding to detect similar images and keep overlapping. The duplicates and\nblurry images are excluded from the selection process to maintain data integrity and accuracy. Using the selected keyframes {IK\nj}k\nj=1, the team estimates the camera poses through a Structure\nfrom Motion approach (i.e., extracting features using a feature detection method, matching them\n4using a matching algorithm, and refining them). In parallel, the team utilizes a segmentation algorithm for reference object segmentation. This\nalgorithm segments the reference object with a user-provided segmentation prompt (i.e., user click),\nproducing a reference object mask MRfor each keyframe. This mask is a foundation for tracking the\nreference object across all frames. The team then applies a memory tracking method, which extends\nthe reference object mask MRto all frames, resulting in a comprehensive set of reference object\nmasks {MR\ni}n\ni=1. This ensures consistency in reference object identification throughout the dataset. To create RGBA images, the team combines the RGB images, reference object masks {MR\ni}n\ni=1, and\nfood object masks {MF\ni}n\ni=1. This step, denoted as {IR\ni}n\ni=1, integrates the various data sources into\na unified format suitable for further processing. The team converts the RGBA images {IR\ni}n\ni=1and camera poses {Cj}k\nj=1into meaningful metadata\nand modeled data Dm. This transformation facilitates the accurate reconstruction of the scene. The modeled data Dmis then input into a neural surface reconstruction algorithm for mesh recon-\nstruction. This algorithm generates colorful meshes {Rf, Rr}for the reference and food objects,\nproviding detailed 3D representations of the scene components. The team applies the \"Remove\nIsolated Pieces\" technique to refine the reconstructed meshes. Given that the scenes contain only\none food item, the team sets the diameter threshold to 5% of the mesh size. This method deletes\nisolated connected components whose diameter is less than or equal to this 5% threshold, resulting in\na cleaned mesh {RCf, RC r}. This step ensures that only significant and relevant parts of the mesh\nare retained. The team manually identifies an initial scaling factor Susing the reference mesh via a mesh processing\ntool for scaling factor identification. This factor is then fine-tuned Sfusing depth information and\nfood and reference masks, ensuring accurate scaling relative to real-world dimensions. To overcome this limitation, the team manually identifies the scaling factor by measuring the distance\nfor each block for the reference object mesh. Next, the team takes the average of all blocks lengths\nlavg, while the actual real-world length is constant lreal= 0.012in meter. Furthermore, the team\napplies the scaling factor S=lreal/lavgon the clean food mesh RCf, producing the final scaled\nfood mesh RFfin meter. The team leverages depth information alongside food and reference object masks to validate the\nscaling factors. The team\u2019s method for assessing food size entails utilizing overhead RGB images\nfor each scene. Initially, the team determines the pixel-per-unit (PPU) ratio (in meters) using the\nreference object. Subsequently, the team extracts the food width (fw) and length (fl) employing a\nfood object mask. To ascertain the food height (fh), the team follows a two-step process. Firstly, the\nteam conducts binary image segmentation using the overhead depth and reference images, yielding a\nsegmented depth image for the reference object. The team then calculates the average depth utilizing\nthe segmented reference object depth (dr). Similarly, employing binary image segmentation with an\noverhead food object mask and depth image, the team computes the average depth for the segmented\nfood depth image (df). Furthermore, to assess the accuracy of the scaling factor S, the team computes\nthe food bounding box volume ((fw \u00d7fl\u00d7fh)\u00d7PPU). The team evaluates if the scaling factor S\ngenerates a food volume close to this potential volume, resulting in Sfine. For one-shot 3D reconstruction, the team leverages a single view reconstruction method for recon-\nstructing a 3D from a single RGBA view input after applying binary image segmentation on both\nfood RGB and mask. Next, the team removes isolated pieces from the generated mesh. After that, the\nteam reuses the scaling factor S, which is closer to the potential volume of the clean mesh. For near-image similarity detection, the Hamming distance\nwas set to 12. To identify blurry images, even numbers within the range of [0...30] were used as the\nGaussian kernel radius. In the process of removing isolated pieces, a diameter threshold of 5% was\napplied. More Briefly, the team leverages\ntheir approach for each food scene separately. A one-shot food volume estimation approach is applied\nif the number of keyframes k equals 1. Otherwise, a few-shot food volume estimation is applied. The team registered their meshes and ground truth meshes to obtain\nthe transformation metrics using ICP. 5 Second Place Team - ININ-VIAUN\n5.1 Methodology\nThis section provides a detailed explanation of the proposed network, demonstrating how to progress\nfrom the original images to the final mesh models step by step. 5.1.1 Scale factor estimation\nThe pipeline for coordinate-level scale factor estimation is described as follows. The team follows\na corner projection matching method. Specifically, using a dense reconstruction model, the team\n6Table 3: Quantitative Comparison of Team\u2019s Approach with Ground Truth\nL Id Team\u2019s V ol. w/o t.m\nE1 40.06 38.53 1.63 85.40\n2 216.9 280.36 7.12 111.47\n3 278.86 249.67 13.69 172.88\n4 279.02 295.13 2.03 61.30\n5 395.76 392.58 13.67 102.14\n6 205.17 218.44 6.68 150.78\n7 372.93 368.77 4.70 66.91\n8 186.62 173.13 2.98 152.34\nM9 224.08 232.74 3.91 160.07\n10 153.76 163.09 2.67 138.45\n11 80.4 85.18 3.37 151.14\n13 363.99 308.28 5.18 147.53\n14 535.44 589.83 4.31 89.66\nH16 163.13 262.15 18.06 28.33\n17 224.08 181.36 9.44 28.94\n18 25.4 20.58 4.28 12.84\n19 110.05 108.35 11.34 23.98\n20 130.96 119.83 15.59 31.05\nTable 4: Overall Method Performance\nMAPE Ch. w/o tm mean\n10.973 0.130 0.007 1.715 0.095\nobtains the pose of each image as well as dense point cloud information. For any image imgk\nand its extrinsic parameters [R|t]k, the team first performs a threshold-based corner detection with\nthe threshold set to 240. This allows them to obtain the pixel coordinates of all detected corners. Subsequently, using the intrinsic parameters k and the extrinsic parameters [R|t]k, the point cloud is\nprojected onto the image plane. The\nmedian of this vector is then used. Then, they apply advanced\nmulti-view 3D reconstruction methods to reconstruct the segmented food. In practice, the team\nemploys three different reconstruction methods. They select the best reconstruction results from these\nmethods and extract the mesh from the reconstructed model. Next, they scale the extracted mesh\nusing the estimated scale factor. They choose a specific method to obtain a 3D food model consistent with the distribution\nof the input image. In practice, they use the intrinsic camera parameters from the fifteenth object\nand employ an optimization method based on reprojection error to refine the extrinsic parameters\nof the single camera. However, due to the limitations of single-view reconstruction, the team needs\nto incorporate depth information from the dataset and the checkerboard in the monocular image to\ndetermine the size of the extracted mesh. To address the holes, the team employs an optimization method based on computational geometry. For surface noise, they utilize Laplacian Smoothing for mesh smoothing operations. The Laplacian\nSmoothing method works by adjusting the position of each vertex to the average of its neighboring\nvertices:\nVnew\ni=Vold\ni+\u03bb\uf8eb\n\uf8ed1\n|N(i)|X\nj\u2208N(i)Vold\nj\u2212Vold\ni\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\nIn their implementation, the team sets the smoothing factor \u03bbto 0.2 and performs 10 iterations. Each image and\nthe corresponding reconstructed 3D model yield a scale factor, and the table presents the average\nscale factor for each object. The\npredicted model vol- umes, ground truth model volumes, and the percentage errors between them are\nshown in Table 6. 8Table 6: Metric of V olume\nObject Index Predicted V olume Ground Truth Error Percentage\n1 44.51 38.53 15.52\n2 321.26 280.36 14.59\n3 336.11 249.67 34.62\n4 347.54 295.13 17.76\n5 389.28 392.58 0.84\n6 197.82 218.44 9.44\n7 412.52 368.77 11.86\n8 181.21 173.13 4.67\n9 233.79 232.74 0.45\n10 160.06 163.09 1.86\n11 86.0 85.18 0.96\n13 334.7 308.28 8.57\n14 517.75 589.83 12.22\n16 176.24 262.15 32.77\n17 180.68 181.36 0.37\n18 13.58 20.58 34.01\n19 117.72 108.35 8.64\n20 117.43 119.83 20.03\n5.2.3 Alignment\nThe team designs a multi-stage alignment method for evaluating reconstruction quality. Figure 13\nillustrates the alignment process for Object 14. First, the team calculates the central points of both the\npredicted model and the ground truth model, and moves the predicted model to align the central point\nof the ground truth model. Next, they perform ICP registration for further alignment, significantly\nreducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, they use gradient descent for additional fine-tuning, and\nobtain the final transformation matrix. The total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models\nand the ground truths is 0.069441169. 6 Best 3D Mesh Reconstruction Team - FoodRiddle\n6.1 Methodology\nTo achieve high-quality food mesh reconstruction, the team designed two pipeline processes. For\nsimple and medium cases, they employed a structure-from-motion approach to determine the pose of\neach image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently, a series of post-processing steps were\nimplemented to recalibrate scale and enhance mesh quality. For cases with only a single image, the\nteam utilized image generation methods to aid in model generation. 6.1.1 Multi-View Reconstruction\nFor Structure from Motion (SfM), the team extended the state-of-the-art method by incorporating\nmethodologies. This significantly mitigated the issue of sparse keypoints in weakly textured scenes. For mesh reconstruction, the team\u2019s method is based on a differentiable renderer and incorporates\nregularization terms for depth distortion and normal consistency. The Truncated Signed Distance\nFunction (TSDF) results are used to generate a dense point cloud. In the post-processing stage, the\nteam applied filtering and outlier removal techniques, identified the contour of the supporting surface,\nand projected the lower mesh vertices onto the supporting surface. They used the reconstructed\ncheckerboard to rectify the scale of the model and used Poisson reconstruction to generate a watertight,\ncomplete mesh of the subject. 6.1.2 Single-View Reconstruction\nFor 3D reconstruction from a single image, the team employed state-of-the-art methods to generate\nan initial prior mesh. This prior mesh was then jointly corrected with depth structure information. 9To adjust the scale, the team estimated the object\u2019s length using the checkerboard as a reference,\nassuming the object and the checkerboard are on the same plane. They then projected the 3D object\nback onto the original 2D image to recover a more accurate scale of the object. This optimization\naimed to align the two meshes as closely as possible in three-dimensional space. The competition\nfeatured 20 diverse food items, captured under various conditions and with varying numbers of input\nimages, specifically designed to challenge participants in developing robust reconstruction models. The evaluation was based on a two-phase process, assessing both portion size accuracy through\nMean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and shape accuracy using the Chamfer distance metric. The innovative approaches developed by\nthe participating teams provide a solid foundation for future research in this field, potentially leading\nto more accurate and user-friendly methods for dietary assessment and monitoring.",
        "Results and Findings": "To tackle these issues, 3D reconstruction provides a viable solution by offering thorough spatial data,\naccommodating different food shapes, possibly functioning with just one image, presenting results\nthat are visually understandable, and facilitating a uniform method for estimating food portions. \u2022 Medium: 30 images. It should be noted that after evaluating Phase-I, some\nissues with the data quality for object 12 (steak) and object 15 (chicken nugget) were found. To\nmaintain the competition\u2019s quality and fairness, these two items have been removed from the final\noverall evaluation. 54.2 Experimental Results\n4.2.1 Implementation settings\nThe experiments were conducted using two GPUs: a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 12GB of memory\nand an RTX 3060 with 6GB of memory. 4.2.2 VolETA Results\nThe team extensively validated their approach on the challenge dataset and compared their results with\nground truth meshes using MAPE and Chamfer distance metrics. The\nteam\u2019s keyframe selection process chooses 34.8% of total frames for the rest of the pipeline, where it\nshows the minimum frames with the highest information.

Based on the pixel coordinates of the corners, the team can identify\nthe closest point coordinates Pk\nifor each corner, where i represents the index of the corner.

        "Methodology": "Building on precedents from other fields and a grow-\ning awareness within the community, this paper seeks to explore how individual\nresearchers responded to this new requirement. This exploration includes their\nopinions, their experiences during the drafting process, and their reflections after\ntheir papers were accepted. Other proposals aim to instill ethical practices earlier in the research stage, before technology\ntransfers into products. The most significant change may be the requirement for a statement of broader impact for all\nsubmissions. Unlike workshops and interdisciplinary tracks, which might be viewed as more specific,\nthis requirement affects every submission, of which there are over 9000 this year. This paper seeks to explore how individual researchers responded to the new\nrequirement, including their perspectives, their experiences and process in drafting the statements,\nand their subsequent thoughts after paper acceptances. This research was initiated through internal discussion at our organization, which then became part\nof a broader public conversation. To collect perspectives from researchers, both within and beyond\nour organization, we developed an online public survey. While it is recognized that researchers are not the\nonly intended audience for these statements, and that others also have responsibilities in ethical\nresearch and technology development, researchers represent a critical mass to mobilize in this effort.

Our questions focused on the process and challenges in completing\nthe submission requirement, the perceived impact of the requirement on paper acceptances, and\nresearchers\u2019 views on the requirement. 3.1 Process and Challenges\nWhen asked about their approach to the broader impact statements, 83.8 percent of respondents\nindicated that they completed this part with their co-authors, without external help. A large\nmajority spent less than 2 hours on the statement, and almost half mentioned it was not challenging to\nprepare. There were differing trends for what could make it difficult. Some viewed their theoretical\nwork as too distant from practical applications, making the exercise speculative. Others perceived\nthe requirement as a \"bureaucratic constraint\". For researchers who\nsubmitted, over 75 percent believed the statements were not taken into consideration, yet almost\n90 percent thought it was unclear how reviewers would evaluate the statements. Postdoctoral/early-career and mid-career respondents were more supportive of the requirement\nframing than students and senior researchers. Some respondents\ndescribed the requirement as \"too broad\" or said they did not feel \"qualified to address the broader\nimpact of their work.\" Some who supported the requirement found the thought process to be valuable\nand that it \"forces researchers to reflect on the impact of their research\". This section proposes how to integrate respondent feedback\ninto future iterations: rethinking the requirement design and framing, developing greater capacity\nand confidence among researchers, and reflecting the shared responsibility of ethical research and\ntechnology development. These attitudes\nmay have a counterproductive effect on an ethical research goal. We encourage program chairs to\nconsider mechanisms to limit that effect (e.g., an incentive for \"best\" broader impact statements). Such mechanisms are important not only to manage negative effects but also to encourage researchers\nwho found the exercise valuable. 4.2 Capacity Building\nGiven that many respondents felt they were not qualified to address the broader impact of their\nwork, workshops may help build capacity over time, and provide a space for researchers to examine\ntheir work with a more diverse group of researchers. Discussions could help develop capacity and\nconfidence, and surface overlooked impacts. Interdisciplinary collaborations could also introduce\nnew guidelines or methodologies such as the theory of change or consequence scanning. Researchers are a critical mass, but others such as conference organizers,\ninstitutions, funders, and users also have roles and responsibilities. To address concerns around\nburden and expertise, the assessment of broader impact could be more of a multi-stakeholder exercise. Initiating a conversation about broader impact is itself a step towards\nestablishing norms and best practices for ethical research. We encourage further work to monitor the\nevolution of researcher\u2019s perspectives, not only at top conferences, but also at-large. 6 Acknowledgements\nThe authors thank No\u00e9mie Lachance, Tara Tressel, and the Research Group for their support and\nparticipation throughout this project. 7 Supplementary Material\nThe survey questions and the responses received are available for further investigation and use.

        "Results and Findings": "We present survey results and key considerations to\ninform the next iteration of the broader impact requirement, should it continue to\nbe mandated for future conferences. Conferences that are typically technical have begun to host workshops on\nsocial impact issues and, in some instances, have announced more interdisciplinary subject areas. The findings from this survey help to\ninform considerations for designing the next iteration of the broader impact requirement, should\nit remain a requirement for future conferences. The survey was split into two sections, one for researchers who submitted to the conference, and\nanother for those who did not. The survey was distributed online via research community channels and on social media. 3 Survey Results\nA total of 50 participants responded to the survey, with the majority identifying as academics (72\npercent) and industry researchers (23.5 percent). There was a balanced breakdown by career stage,\nwith graduate students making up the largest group of respondents (33 percent). Researchers at different stages of their career found\nthe exercise more or less challenging, but their professional domain did not appear to affect their\nexperienced difficulty with the exercise. Even with an\nunclear evaluation process, when asked how confident they were that their statement was adequately\naddressing the requirement, 43.2 percent stated that they were either confident or very confident. Time spent did not seem to have an impact, since most of the respondents who spent less than an\nhour also received acceptances. Those who sought external help appeared to have a lower ratio of\nrejections, but our sample size may be too small to draw conclusive results. Our results indicated\nthat the community was divided on how to frame the requirement; 56 percent did not agree that\nbroader impact was the right way to frame the requirement, while 44 percent did. 4 Integrating Feedback into Next Iteration of Broader Impact\nThe survey results inform future iterations of the broader impact requirement. When asked what\ncould have helped them most, 92 percent of respondents indicated that examples of statements\n2would be most helpful. While written statements make sense given the paper-based nature of submissions, survey\nrespondents indicated a mix of nonchalance, outright farce, or perceived burden. While the\nsurvey represented a small sample of the community, its results demonstrate a division regarding\nhow the requirement is framed.",
        "Conclusion": "5 Conclusion\nThis paper and its underlying survey investigated how researchers approached the broader impact\nstatement and surfaced considerations to better design this requirement in future years. 3"

In order to facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between logic circuits\nand their environment, we have developed a bespoke framework that incorporates elements of systems\ntheory, chaos theory, and the study of complex adaptive systems, all of which are deemed essential\nfor capturing the emergent properties and nonlinear dynamics that characterize the behavior of logic\ncircuits, particularly in the context of high-speed digital signal processing and the propagation of\nelectromagnetic waves through various media, including, but not limited to, coaxial cables, fiber optic\ncables, and the human brain, a topic that has been explored in various studies on neuroplasticity and\nthe neural correlates of consciousness.

However, further study is needed to\nfully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to explore the potential applications of this technology. By embracing this interdisciplinary approach and incorporating\nconcepts such as \"flumplenook\" dynamics and \"flibberflamber\" theory, we can create more efficient,\nmore stable, and more versatile logic circuits that can be used to solve a variety of complex problems. This, in turn, has led to the creation of novel \"wug-\nglepants\" detectors and \"flarpmax\" algorithms, which have greatly enhanced our understanding of the\nunderlying mechanisms and have opened up new avenues for research.

        "Abstract": "Enhanced Vocabulary Handling in Recurrent Neural Networks\nThrough Positional Encoding\nAbstract\nThis research presents a counterintuitive discovery: positional encoding, a high-dimensional representation of\ntemporal indices, improves the learning capabilities of recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

Thus, positional encoding is not a panacea for arbitrary tasks, and further investigations are\nnecessary to determine when it is effective.",
        "Methodology": "A detailed\nanalysis reveals that these infrequent tokens introduce instability to the gradients of standard RNNs, and positional\nencoding effectively counteracts this instability. 1 Introduction\nSince their introduction, Transformer neural networks have become the preferred method for processing and generating time series\ndata, surpassing traditional models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RNNs encode this information by sequentially updating their internal state based on both the current input\nand the preceding state. Its most common\nimplementation involves the use of sinusoidal waves with predetermined frequencies. This method \"timestamps\" input tokens\nby adding or concatenating these encoding vectors to the corresponding input embeddings. In contrast to RNNs, the temporal\nrepresentation provided by positional encoding remains unchanged by input values until processed collectively by a network. Although positional encoding has often been viewed as a substitute for the temporal processing capabilities of RNNs when used\nwith Transformers, the two are not inherently incompatible. This study, therefore, investigates the application of positional encoding to the inputs of RNNs using synthetic benchmarks. The contributions of this research are outlined as follows:\n\u2022Challenges in training RNNs with extensive vocabularies are shown through carefully designed benchmark tasks. \u2022The identified training challenges for RNNs with large vocabularies are explained by gradient instability caused by\ninfrequent tokens, which are inevitable when expanding vocabulary size. Even RNNs with random recurrent and input-to-hidden weights, known as reservoir\ncomputers, can achieve universal approximation if their hidden-to-output weights are idealized. These theoretical insights have\ndriven the use of RNNs in processing complex time series like human languages and weather patterns. However, in practical scenarios, RNN weights are limited by finite precision and must be optimized based on a finite set of data\nobservations. These constraints place limitations on the actual capabilities of RNNs. This issue of memory duration has\nbeen a focal point for researchers, leading to extensive exploration of RNN architectures that can retain memory for longer periods. More recently, the focus of research on extending memory retention has moved towards continuous-time models. Instead of\nrepresenting the memory of an input sequence through discrete-time changes in a latent state, these models approximate the input\nhistory using a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials in continuous-time space. Consequently, input tokens to a Transformer are \"time-stamped\" by adding or concatenating a position-encoding\nvector. While this original encoding method is effective for a wide range of tasks, researchers have also explored other\npossibilities. Some research has also indicated that combining sinusoidal and learnable encoding can enhance model performance. Another approach involves encoding the distance between tokens rather than the time elapsed since the beginning of the sequence. Furthermore, the effec-\ntiveness of positional encoding is not restricted to temporal information; previous studies in three-dimensional mesh/point-cloud\nmodeling have shown that sinusoidal transformation of spatial data improves model performance compared to using raw coordinate\nrepresentations. Despite the extensive use of positional encoding across various areas of machine learning, its application to pure RNNs remains\nlargely unexplored. In another study, which predates the introduction of sinusoidal positional encoding in the deep learning\ncommunity, Vincent-Lamarre et al. As an exception, Neil et al. (2016) introduced a periodic gating mechanism for updating the state and\nmemory cell of LSTM. This periodic gating was scheduled based on a triangular wave interspersed with a plateau at the floor value\n(= 0.0; the frequency, phase, and duration of the wave phase were learnable parameters). 3 Methods\n3.1 Task\nThe impact of positional encoding on RNNs was examined using a reverse-ordering task. In this task, RNNs were trained to\nreconstruct a sequence of random integers in reverse order. Each integer in the input sequences was first embedded, then concatenated\n2with the positional encoding, and subsequently fed into the RNN/S4D. After processing the entire input sequence, the network\nreceived a command to produce the output. The outputs from the RNN/S4D module were linearly projected into classification logits. The\ncross-entropy loss between these logits and the target sequence was used to optimize the entire network. Model predictions during\nthe testing phase were determined by the argmax of these logits for each time step. This study used the standard sinusoidal positional encoding designed for Transformers. Specifically, each time step t was encoded by\nthe Dpos-dimensional vector, defined as follows:\nPEt, 2i:= sin\u0012t\u22121\n100002(i\u22121)\nDpos\u0013\n(1)\nPEt, 2i+ 1 := cos\u0012t\u22121\n100002(i\u22121)\nDpos\u0013\n(2)\nFor learning stability, the positional encoding was divided by the square root of Dpos/2, ensuring that the encoding vectors had a\nunit L2-norm. The time step t incremented throughout both the input and output phases (i.e., t = 1, ..., L, L+1, ..., 2L, where L is the\ninput length), without any hard-coded association between the input and output positions. 3.3 Implementation Details\nAcross the experiments, the dimensionality of the hidden layer of the RNNs was set to 512. The models were trained for 300,000 iterations using the Adam optimizer with parameters ( \u02d803b21, \u02d803b22) := (0.9, 0.999) and no\nweight decay. The learning rate was linearly warmed up from 0.0 to 0.001 for the first 1,000 iterations, and then annealed according\nto the cosine schedule. The batch size was 512. All experiments were implemented in PyTorch (ver. 2.1.1) and each training-test trial was executed on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU\n(with 80GB VRAM). In contrast, the performance of the standard\nmodels without positional encoding deteriorated as the vocabulary size increased. Similarly, positional encoding improved the\ncapacity of S4D to handle large vocabularies. These improvements are also evident in the reduced sequence-wise reconstruction\nerrors, as measured by the Damerau-Levenshtein distance. Neither additional training iterations nor larger batch sizes improved the\nperformance of the standard models. Therefore, additional experiments were conducted with non-uniformly distributed tokens to examine the relationship between\ntoken frequency and RNN performance. Specifically, the input vocabulary was evenly divided into Frequent and Rare groups, with\nFrequent tokens having three times the probability of Rare tokens. The test data were systematically\nconstructed so that each sequence included a single \"target\" token (Frequent/Rare) whose retrieval accuracy was assessed, along\nwith 63 \"disturbants\" that were either all Frequent or all Rare. Rare targets were successfully retrieved as long as they were\nsurrounded by Frequent disturbants. However, the standard GRU struggled to recover Frequent targets when the other input tokens\nwere filled with Rare disturbants. Similarly, Rare disturbants were detrimental to S4D; unlike the RNNs, the accuracy was\nlowest when targets were located in the middle of the input sequences (17 \u02d82264 t \u02d82264 32). 3In contrast, the position-encoded RNNs showed robustness to the frequency of both target and disturbant tokens. They achieved\nnearly perfect accuracies in most cases, except when the GRU processed fully Rare data with the target in the first half of the\nsequence (1 \u02d82264 t \u02d82264 32). Likewise, positional encoding enhanced the resilience of S4D against the influence of Rare disturbants. 4.3 Analysis of Gradient Stability\nTo further investigate the influence of token frequency on RNN performance, the gradients of the RNN latent states were analyzed. Pairs of input sequences were processed by RNNs trained on the dual-frequency vocabulary. Gradients were then computed for the distant\nmapping between the first and last updated states (at t = 1 and 2L) of the RNNs using backpropagation through time. The stability\nof RNN learning was assessed by measuring the dot-product similarity of the gradients between the paired input sequences (after\nnormalization over output dimensions). Formally, the paired input sequences, denoted as A and B, established two distinct, but ideally similar mappings, f(A) and f(B), from\nthe first to the last latent state of the RNNs. Therefore, for the analysis of S4D, the target token was positioned\nin the middle at t = 23, where the standard model exhibited its poorest accuracy with Rare disturbants. The disturbants were prefixed\nand suffixed to this target to construct input sequences. The prefix disturbants were shared between the paired sequences, ensuring\nthat the latent dynamics of the model remained identical up to the target token. For this analysis, the complex-valued gradients were treated as\ndouble-sized real arrays, and a real-valued similarity was defined by Eq. This is equivalent to taking the real component of the\ncomplex-valued similarity and is intuitively natural given that a perfect alignment between complex gradient directions yields a\nreal-valued score of 1.0. Most notably, positional encoding endowed the RNNs with robustness to these Rare disturbants. Both the GRU and LSTM\nmaintained high similarity of the paired gradients across different target/disturbant conditions. Consequently, gradient stability\ndoes not fully account for the decline in S4D accuracy in the presence of Rare disturbants, nor does it explain the enhancement\nbrought about by positional encoding. This research examined RNN gradients and identified their destabilization when processing low-frequency tokens, which are\nnecessarily included in a large vocabulary. Consequently, each token exhibits a dual nature\u2014both crucial and noisy\u2014throughout the task. Processing rare tokens is particularly\nchallenging, presumably because they are irrelevant most of the time while making a large impact on learning through the greater\nloss to compensate for their fewer learning opportunities. This enhancement of RNNs via positional encoding is noteworthy because RNNs were specifically\ndesigned to process time series data on their own; hence, unlike Transformers, they are presumed to function without relying on an\n\"external clock\". 1, 2), leaving it open which parameters\nof the sinusoidal waves (i.e., frequencies and phases) are critical for gradient stabilization. Moreover, the analysis of gradient stability did not fully address the enhanced performance of the position-encoded state-space\nmodel (S4D). In terms of accuracy, the positioned-encoded S4D exhibited greater robustness to infrequent tokens compared to the\nstandard model, resembling the behavior observed in RNNs. However, the gradients of the standard S4D were too stable to account\nfor this decline in performance. This leaves open the question of how positional encoding influences gradient-based learning of\nstate-space models. Additionally, future studies may investigate a broader range of state-space models\u2014including the state-of-the-art\narchitecture of Mamba\u2014to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between positional encoding and these models. Although positional encoding enhanced model performance across different synthetic tasks,\nthe extent of this enhancement is task-dependent. Extending the reverse-ordering task, the models received additional random input integers during the output\nphase, and added each of them to the corresponding token in the reverse-ordered input sequence (modulo the vocabulary size, so that\nthe output range was bounded). Also, the network was trained for 600,000 iterations (i.e., twice longer than the other tasks) for ensuring the convergence. The other conditions/hyperparameters were the same as reported in the main text. Consequently, positional encoding improved the model performance as the vocabulary size grew from 896 to 1088. The input integers were uniformly randomly sampled with replacement, allowing for ties in the sorting process. As a result, positional encoding also proved effective for RNNs to handle a larger vocabulary in the sorting task, though the\nimprovement remained marginal compared to the reverse-ordering task. The network first received a sequence of non-repeating\nrandom integers, x1, . Subsequently, one of the non-initial input integers, xtquery (2 \u02d82264 tquery \u02d82264 L), was randomly\nselected and reintroduced to the network at time t = L + 1. The learning objective is to return the predecessor of the reviewed integer\n(= xtquery \u02d822121). The number of training iterations was maintained at 300,000. One might wonder if positional encoding is exceptionally\neffective under this setting, informing RNNs with the exact timing when each input token should be returned as the output. Thus, it\nremains unclear whether or not position-encoded RNNs can also handle a larger vocabulary even when the input length is variable\nand, thus, the exact timing of the output emission is not identifiable from the positional encoding attached to the inputs. In this setup, the maximum input length (= 64) covers the entirety of the shortest input sequence\nplus its reversed reconstruction (= 32 + 32). As a result, the positional encoding still improved the LSTM\u2019s performance on the reverse-ordering task against the perturbations in\nthe input length. This section substantiates this argument by equalizing the\nnumber of learnable parameters between the standard and position-encoded models. Specifically, the equalization was achieved by concatenating two identical copies of the input embeddings and feeding them to the\nLSTM. The double standard LSTM did not yield any improvements in the reverse-ordering or sort- ing tasks. For instance, the BERT-based models typically encode each token position by a learnable embedding. Moreover, it\nhas been pointed out that even random vectors can function as positional encoding. The random position-encoding vectors were uniformly and independently sampled from the (512 - 1)- dimensional hypersphere. The learnable embeddings were implemented using the canonical embedding module of PyTorch (torch.nn.Embedding). The input\nlength and vocabulary size were set to 64 and 16,384 respectively. The\nadvantage of the sinusoidal encoding became more apparent when the input length was variable between 32 and 64; the sinusoidal\nencoding was more robust to the variations in the input length than the others. Due to constraints in computational resources, the vocabulary was\nreduced from the original size of 267,735 to 32,768 by retokenizing the raw data using SentencePiece. The headings were removed,\nand the main text was segmented by paragraphs (separated by the line break). Additionally, only the first 1024 tokens of each\nparagraph were utilized for training and testing, ensuring that the absolute positional encoding always aligned with the beginning of\neach paragraph. The hyperparameters were configured as specified in Section 3.3.",
        "Results and Findings": "However, our experiments with\nsynthetic benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating positional encoding into RNNs enhances their performance,\nparticularly when dealing with extensive vocabularies that result in numerous low-frequency tokens. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized benefit of\npositional encoding, extending its utility beyond its conventional function as a temporal marker for Transformers. Positional encoding offers a high-dimensional representation of the temporal indices associated with input data. The\nresults demonstrate that positional encoding helps RNNs manage a more diverse set of discrete inputs, effectively handling a larger\nvocabulary, compared to those without positional encoding. \u2022A new effectiveness of positional encoding is revealed by combining it with RNNs, showing it mitigates the large-vocabulary\nissue by stabilizing RNN gradients against the disruptions caused by infrequent tokens.2 Related Studies\n2.1 Theoretical and Empirical Computational Power of (Vanilla) RNNs\nMathematically, RNNs are recognized as Turing-complete, meaning they can simulate any Turing machine if their weights have\nunlimited precision and are perfectly tuned. 2.2 Positional Encoding\nPositional encoding serves as a high-dimensional representation of the temporal structures present in input data.

The\nposition-encoded GRU and LSTM successfully reversed input sequences of 64 integers drawn uniformly at random from vocabularies\nof sizes 32-256 and 256-16,384, respectively, achieving token-wise accuracy above 95%. The probability of each Frequent token was 7/8 \u02d800d7 2/K (where\nK is the total vocabulary size, set to 64, 1024, and 2048 for GRU, LSTM, and S4D, respectively), while the probability of each Rare\ntoken was 1/8 \u02d800d7 2/K. The experiment revealed that the frequency of the disturbant tokens\nsignificantly affected the performance of the standard RNNs and S4D. . . , D:\n\u03b1(s)\ni:=vuuut\uf8eb\n\uf8ed2DX\nj=1 \n\u2202h(s)\n2L,i\n\u2202z1,j!2\uf8f6\n\uf8f8,vuuut\uf8eb\n\uf8edDX\nk=1\uf8eb\n\uf8ed2DX\nj=1 \n\u2202h(s)\n2L,k\n\u2202z1,j!2\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (4)\nConsequently, the stability metric emphasizes the consistency of the paired gradients that both have a greater L2-norm across the\noutput dimensions. Unlike the RNN models, both the standard and position-encoded S4Ds achieved high accuracy over 96% for the initial target token\n(t = 1), regardless of the frequency of the target and disturbants. Monitoring the gradients at training checkpoints revealed that Rare disturbants destabilize the learning of standard RNNs. The\nsimilarity of the paired gradients decreased gradually (GRU) or rapidly (LSTM) when the networks were exposed to Rare disturbants. In contrast, the impact of positional\nencoding on the gradient stability of S4D was marginal; unlike the RNNs, the standard S4D was highly stable by itself against Rare\ndisturbants throughout training, although there was a visible relative destabilization due to Rare disturbants compared to Frequent\ndisturbants in the early stages of training, as well as an observable improvement by positional encoding. It is also noteworthy that\nthe difference between Frequent and Rare disturbants diminished after 10,000 training iterations. Specifically, inputs that do not contribute to gradient-based optimization at a target time\nstep (e.g., tokens at 2 \u02d82264 t \u02d82264 L upon the retrieval of the initial token at t = 2L in the reverse-ordering task) were found to be\ndetrimental. 5.2 Functionality of Positional Encoding beyond the Timekeeper for Transformers\nAlthough low-frequency tokens destabilize the gradient-based learning of RNNs, this study also discovered that this issue can be\nalleviated by positional encoding. The findings of this study\u2014namely, the improvement in the manageable vocabulary size due to enhanced\ngradient stability\u2014broaden the currently limited understanding of the impact of positional encoding on RNNs. Additionally, the results of this study shed new light on the utility of positional encoding. All\nfindings here are based on experimental investigations, lacking rigorous mathematical explanations for how and why the gradients of\nRNNs are destabilized by infrequent tokens and stabilized by positional encoding. Indeed, while a previous study reported the effectiveness of positional encoding\nfor an LSTM text summarizer, the present study found no empirical advantage for the language modeling task, aside from a slightly\nmore rapid decline in training loss. This task was too challenging to GRUs\u2014even after reducing the input length to L = 16\u2014so only the results from LSTMs are reported\nbelow. This section reports the effectiveness of positional encoding for a task in which the order of input observations was completely\nirrelevant; the learning objective was to simply sort the input integers in their inherent ascending order (e.g. 8, 29, 2, 11 \u02d82192 2, 8,\n11, 29). . . As in the reverse-ordering + delayed-addition task, the input sequence was reduced to L = 16 due to the complexity of the task, and\nthe experiment focused on the LSTM. To assess the robustness to variations in the input length, an additional experiment was conducted on the LSTM, with the input\nlength varied between 32 and 64. . . The vocabulary size was set to 16,384. This result suggests that the effectiveness of the positional encoding for RNNs is not limited to strictly scheduled\ntasks. These results affirm that the\nreported enhancement of RNNs is not merely attributable to the additional parameterization associated with the positional encoding. Accordingly, these two alternative forms of positional encoding were tested on the LSTM performing the reverse- ordering task. Among the different implementations of positional encoding, the sinusoidal encoding outperformed the two alterna- tives. 6.5 E Language Modeling\nThis section reports benchmark results for the language modeling task. Single-layer LSTMs with and without sinusoidal positional\nencoding were trained and tested on the WikiText-103 dataset. Positional encoding proved effective only for marginally faster learning during the initial phase of training.

        "Abstract": "Large Vocabulary Handling in Recurrent Neural\nNetworks Enhanced by Positional Encoding\nAbstract\nThis research presents a counterintuitive discovery: positional encoding, a high-\ndimensional representation of time indices on input data, improves the learning\ncapabilities of recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

Thus, positional encoding is not a panacea for arbitrary tasks, and further investigations\nare necessary to determine when it is effective.",
        "Methodology": "Although positional encoding is\nwidely recognized for complementing Transformer neural networks by enabling\nthem to process data order, its application to RNNs seems unnecessary because\nRNNs inherently encode temporal information. However, our analysis using syn-\nthetic benchmarks shows that combining positional encoding with RNNs offers\nadvantages, especially when dealing with extensive vocabularies that include low-\nfrequency tokens. Further investigation reveals that these infrequent tokens cause\ninstability in the gradients of standard RNNs, and positional encoding helps to miti-\ngate this instability. 1 Introduction\nSince their introduction, Transformer neural networks have become the preferred method for pro-\ncessing and generating time series data, surpassing traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A\nsignificant difference between these models is their handling of temporal information, that is, the\nsequence of data points or tokens. RNNs process temporal information by adjusting their internal\nstate based on new inputs and their existing state. A common method\ninvolves using sinusoidal waves of predetermined frequencies. This method marks input tokens by\nadding or appending these vectors to the input embeddings. Unlike RNNs, positional encoding\u2019s time\nrepresentation remains constant regardless of input values until processed by a network. Although positional encoding is often viewed as a way to represent time that can replace RNNs when\nused with Transformers, it is not incompatible with RNNs. Inputs to RNNs can be augmented with\nposition-encoding vectors. This study, therefore, investigates the effects of adding positional encoding to the inputs of RNNs,\nusing synthetic benchmarks. The key contributions of this research are outlined below:\n\u2022It illustrates the challenges faced when training RNNs on large vocabularies using carefully\ndesigned benchmark tasks, a problem that has not been widely recognized or addressed in\nprevious research, despite its potential impact on practical applications. .\u2022It explains that the difficulties in training RNNs with extensive vocabularies are due to\ngradient instability caused by infrequent tokens, which inevitably occur as vocabulary size\nincreases. \u2022It introduces a novel use of positional encoding, beyond its typical role in timing for\nTransformers, by integrating it with RNNs. In practice, however, RNN\nweights are limited by finite precision and the need to optimize based on a finite set of observations. These constraints impose practical limitations on the capabilities of RNNs. More recently, research into extending memory retention has explored continuous-time models. Instead of modifying a latent state in discrete-time steps, these models use a linear combination\nof orthogonal polynomials in a continuous-time domain to approximate the input history. This method is particularly crucial for Transformers, which, unlike RNNs, do not\ninherently capture the order of inputs. Therefore, input tokens to a Transformer are \"time-stamped\"\nby adding or concatenating a position-encoding vector. Although this method is effective for a wide range of tasks,\nresearchers have explored other encoding schemes as well. Some studies have suggested that combining sinusoidal and learnable encodings can enhance model\nperformance. Another approach is to encode the distance between tokens instead of the time elapsed\nfrom the sequence\u2019s beginning. Its effectiveness is not limited to temporal information; studies on three-dimensional mesh and\npoint-cloud modeling have shown that sinusoidal transformation of spatial data outperforms raw\ncoordinate representation. Despite its widespread use across various areas of machine learning, the application of positional\nencoding to pure RNNs has been largely unexplored. In this task,\nRNNs were trained to reconstruct a sequence of random integers in reverse order (e.g., given 8, 29, 2,\n11, the output should be 11, 2, 29, 8). Each integer in the input sequences\nwas first embedded, concatenated with its positional encoding, and then fed into the RNN or S4D. After processing the entire input sequence, the network received a command to produce the output,\nrepresented by a time-invariant learnable vector. The outputs from the RNN or S4D module were\nlinearly projected into classification logits, and the cross-entropy loss against the target sequence was\nused to optimize the entire network. Model predictions during testing were determined by the argmax\nof these logits for each time step. Specifically, each time step twas encoded by a Dpos-dimensional vector, (PEt,1, ..., PE t,Dpos)T,\ndefined as follows:\nPEt,2i:= sin \nt\u22121\n100002(i\u22121)\nDpos! The time step tincremented throughout both input and\noutput phases (i.e., t= 1, ..., L, L + 1, ...,2L, where Lis the input length), without any hard-coded\nlink between input and output positions. 3.3 Implementation Details\nAcross the experiments, the dimensionality of the hidden layer of the RNNs was set to 512. The models were trained for 300,000 iterations using the Adam optimizer with parameters ( \u03b21, \u03b22) :=\n(0.9, 0.999) and no weight decay. The learning rate was linearly warmed up from 0.0 to 0.001 for the\nfirst 1,000 iterations, and then annealed according to the cosine schedule. The batch size was 512. All experiments were implemented in PyTorch (ver. In contrast, the performance of the vanilla models without positional\nencoding degraded as the vocabulary size increased. Similarly, positional encoding enhanced the\ncapacity of S4D to handle large vocabularies. These improvements are also evident in the reduced\nsequence-wise reconstruction errors, measured by the Damerau-Levenshtein distance. Accordingly, additional experiments were conducted with non-uniformly\ndistributed tokens to investigate the relation between their frequency and RNN performance. By\ncontrast, the test data were systematically constructed so that each sequence included a single\n\"target\" token (Frequent/Rare) whose retrieval was evaluated for accuracy assessment, along with\n63 \"disturbants\" that were either all Frequent or all Rare. On the other hand, the vanilla GRU struggled to recover the Frequent\ntargets when the other input tokens were filled with the Rare disturbants. Similarly, the Rare disturbants were detrimental to the S4D; unlike the RNNs, however,\nthe accuracy was worst when the targets were located in the middle of the input sequences (17 \u2264t\u2264\n32). In contrast, the position-encoded RNNs exhibited robustness to the frequency of the target and\ndisturbant tokens. They achieved nearly perfect accuracies in most cases, except when the GRU\nprocessed the fully Rare data whose target was located in the first half of the sequence (1 \u2264t\u2264\n32). Likewise, positional encoding enhanced the resilience of the S4D against the influence of Rare\ndisturbants. 4.3 Analysis of Gradient Stability\nTo delve deeper into the influence of token frequency on RNN performance, the gradients of the\nRNN latent states were scrutinized. In the analysis, pairs of input sequences were processed by the\nRNNs trained on the dual-frequency vocabulary (comprising Frequent and Rare items). Then, gradients were computed for the distant mapping between the first\nand last updated states (i.e., at time t = 1 and 2L) of the RNNs using backpropagation through time. The stability of RNN learning was assessed by measuring the dot-product similarity of the gradients\nbetween the paired input sequences (after normalization over output dimensions). Positional encoding endowed the RNNs\nwith robustness to these RARE disturbants. Both the GRU and LSTM maintained the high similarity\nof the paired gradients across the different target/disturbant conditions. While the manageable vocabulary size of RNNs is a pertinent research area, crucial for empirical\napplications like natural language processing, previous studies have primarily focused on evaluating\nand improving the memory duration of RNNs, typically with small vocabulary sizes. This research examined RNN gradients and identified their destabilization when processing low-\nfrequency tokens, which are necessarily included in a large vocabulary. Consequently, each token exhibits a dual nature\u2014both crucial and\nnoisy\u2014throughout the task. Processing rare tokens is particularly challenging, presumably because\nthey are irrelevant most of the time while making a large impact on learning due to their greater loss,\ncompensating for fewer learning opportunities. This enhancement of RNNs via positional\nencoding is noteworthy because RNNs were specifically designed to process time series data on\ntheir own. Moreover, the present study primarily focused\non the canonical implementation of sinusoidal positional encoding designed for Transformers, leaving\nopen which parameters of the sinusoidal waves (i.e., frequencies and phases) are critical for gradient\nstabilization. Moreover, the analysis of gradient stability did not fully address the enhanced performance of\nthe position-encoded state-space model (S4D). However, the gradients of the vanilla S4D were too stable to account for\nthis decline in performance. This leaves open the question of how positional encoding influences\ngradient-based learning of state-space models. Additionally, future studies may investigate a broader\nrange of state-space models to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between\npositional encoding and these models. Although positional encoding\nenhanced model performance across different synthetic tasks, the extent of this enhancement is task-\ndependent. Extending the reverse-ordering task, the models\nreceived additional random input integers during the output phase, and added each of them to the\ncorresponding token in the reverse-ordered input sequence (modulo the vocabulary size, so that the\noutput range was bounded). Also, the network was trained\nfor 600,000 iterations (i.e., twice longer than the other tasks) for ensuring the convergence. The other\nconditions/hyperparameters were the same as reported in the main text. Consequently, positional\nencoding improved the model performance as the vocabulary size grew from 896 to 1088. Thus, positional encoding may play its originally intended role in encoding the temporal\ninformation. This section reports the effectiveness of positional encoding for a task in which the order of input\nobservations was completely irrelevant; the learning objective was to simply sort the input integers in\ntheir inherent ascending order (e.g. The input integers were uniformly\nrandomly sampled with replacement, allowing for ties in the sorting process. The network first\nreceived a sequence of non-repeating random integers, x1, ..., x L. Subsequently, one of the non-initial\ninput integers, xtquery (2\u2264tquery\u2264L), was randomly selected and reintroduced to the network\nat time t = L + 1. The learning objective is to return the predecessor of the reviewed integer (=\nxtquery\u22121). Thus, it remains unclear whether\nor not position-encoded RNNs can also handle a larger vocabulary even when the input length is\nvariable and, thus, the exact timing of the output emission is not identifiable from the positional\nencoding attached to the inputs. In this setup, the maximum input length\n(= 64) covers the entirety of the shortest input sequence plus its reversed reconstruction (= 32 + 32). As a result, the positional encoding still improved the LSTM\u2019s performance on the reverse-ordering\ntask against the perturbations in the input length. Specifically, the equalization was achieved by concatenating two identical copies of the input\nembeddings and feeding them to the LSTM. For instance, the BERT-based models typically encode\neach token position by a learnable embedding. The random position-encoding vectors were uniformly and independently\nsampled from the (512 1)- dimensional hypersphere. The learnable embeddings were implemented\nusing the canonical embedding module of PyTorch (torch.nn.Embedding). The input length and\nvocabulary size were set to 64 and 16,384 respectively. The advantage of the sinusoidal encoding became more apparent when the input\nlength was variable between 32 and 64; the sinusoidal encoding was more robust to the variations in\nthe input length than the others. Single-layer LSTMs with\nand without sinusoidal positional encoding were trained and tested on the WikiText-103 dataset. Due to constraints in computational resources, the vocabulary was reduced from the original size of\n267,735 to 32,768 by retokenizing the raw data using SentencePiece. The headings were removed,\nand the main text was segmented by paragraphs (separated by the line break). Additionally, only the\nfirst 1024 tokens of each paragraph were utilized for training and testing, ensuring that the absolute\npositional encoding always aligned with the beginning of each paragraph. The hyperparameters were\nconfigured as specified in \u00a73.3.",

        "Abstract": "Background Modeling Using Adaptive Pixelwise\nKernel Variances in a Hybrid Feature Space\nAbstract\nRecent work on background subtraction has shown developments on two major\nfronts. 2Let a pixel sample a = [ax, ay, ar, ag, ab], where (ax, ay) are the location of the pixel and (ar, ag, ab)\nare the red, green, and blue values of the pixel.

        "Methodology": "In one, there has been increasing sophistication of probabilistic models,\nfrom mixtures of Gaussians at each pixel, to kernel density estimates at each\npixel, and more recently to joint domain-range density estimates that incorporate\nspatial information. We give a heuristic method for\nselectively applying the adaptive kernel calculations which is nearly as accurate as\nthe full procedure but runs much faster. A\ncommon approach to background modeling is to define and learn a background distribution over\nfeature values at each pixel location and then classify each image pixel as belonging to the background\nprocess or not. The distributions at each pixel may be modeled in a parametric manner using a mixture\nof Gaussians or using non-parametric kernel density estimation. More recently, models that allow\na pixel\u2019s spatial neighbors to influence its distribution have been developed by joint domain-range\ndensity estimation. Also, the use of an explicit foreground model along with a background model can be useful. In a\nmanner similar to theirs, we use a kernel estimate to obtain the background and foreground scores\nat each pixel location using data samples from a spatial neighborhood around that location from\nprevious frames. The background score is computed as a kernel estimate depending on the distance\nin the joint domain-range space between the estimation point and the samples in the background\nmodel. A similar estimate is obtained for the foreground score. Each pixel is then assigned a (soft)\nlabel based on the ratio of the background and foreground scores. The variance used in the estimation kernel reflects the spatial and appearance uncertainties in the\nscene. The leaf regions\nmay be better explained by a process with a large variance. Interestingly, when there is no wind, the\nleaf regions may also be explained with a low variance. This phenomenon is captured reasonably in MoG by\nuse of different parameters for each pixel which adapt dynamically to the scene statistics, but the\npixel-wise model does not allow a pixel\u2019s neighbors to affect its distribution. address the phenomenon\nby updating the model with data samples from the most recent frame. Our\napproach with pixel-wise variances, which we call the variable kernel score (VKS) method results in\nsignificant improvement over uniform variance models and state of the art backgrounding systems. Although use a uniform\nvariance, they discuss the use of variances that change as a function of the data samples or as a\nfunction of the point at which the estimation is made. While require that the uncertainties\nin the feature values can be calculated in closed form, learn the covariances for each pixel from a\ntraining set of frames and keep the learned covariances fixed for the entire classification phase. We\nuse a maximum-likelihood approach to select the best variance at each pixel location. For every\nframe of the video, at each pixel location, the best variance is picked from a set of variance values\nby maximizing the likelihood of the pixel\u2019s observation under different variances. By explicitly selecting the best variance from a range of variance values,\nwe do not require the covariances to be calculable in closed-form and also allow for more flexibility\nat the classification stage. Selecting the best of many kernel variances for each pixel means increased computation. One possible\ntrade-off between accuracy and speed can be achieved by a caching scheme where the best kernel\nvariances from the previous frame are used to calculate the scores for the current frame pixels. If the\nresulting classification is overwhelmingly in favor of either label, there is no need to perform a search\nfor the best kernel variance for that pixel. The expensive variance selection procedure can be applied\nonly to pixels where there is some contention between the two labels. The main contributions of this paper are:\n1. A heuristic for selectively updating variances to improve speed further. We refer to any phenomenon that can affect image pixel\nvalues as a process. Like , we model the background and foreground processes using data samples\nfrom previous frames. The scores for the background and foreground processes at each pixel location\nare calculated using contributions from the data samples in each model. One major difference between\nand our model is that we allow \u201csoft labeling\u201d, i.e. the data samples contribute probabilistically to the\nbackground score depending on the samples\u2019 probability of belonging to the background. In each frame of the video, we compute background\nand foreground scores using pixel samples from the previous frames. A large spatial covariance allows neighboring pixels to contribute more to the score at a\ngiven pixel location. Use of NB in the denominator compensates for the different lengths of the background and\nforeground models. The above equation basically sums the contribution from each background sample based on its\ndistance in color space, weighted by its distance in spatial dimensions and the probability of the\nsample belonging to the background. However, for the foreground process, to account for emergence of new colors in the scene, we mix\nin a constant contribution independent of the estimation point\u2019s and data samples\u2019 color values. We\nassume that each data sample in a pixel\u2019s spatial neighborhood contributes a constant value u to the\nforeground score. The constant contribution UF (a) is given by\nUF(a;\u03c3d\nF) =NFX\ni=1u\u00d7G(axy\u2212fixy;\u03c3d\nF) (5)\nWe get a modified foreground score by including the constant contribution:\n\u02c6SF(a;\u03c3d\nF, \u03c3rgb\nF) =\u03b1F\u00d7UF(a;\u03c3d\nF) + (1 \u2212\u03b1F)\u00d7SF(a;\u03c3d\nF, \u03c3rgb\nF). (6)\nF is a parameter that represents the amount of mixing between the constant contribution and the color\ndependent foreground score. To classify a particular sample as background or foreground, we can use a Bayes-like formula:\nP(bg|a) =SB(a;\u03c3d\nB, \u03c3rgb\nB)\nSB(a;\u03c3d\nB, \u03c3rgb\nB) +\u02c6SF(a;\u03c3d\nF, \u03c3rgb\nF)(7)\n3P(fg|a) = 1\u2212P(bg|a). However, if both the background\nand foreground scores are less than U , then Equation 7 will return a low value as P (bg|a). Hence,\nan observation that has very low background and foreground scores will be classified as foreground. 2.1 Model initialization and update\nTo initialize the models, it is assumed that the first few frames (typically 50) are all background pixels. The background model is populated using pixel samples from these frames. In order to improve\nefficiency, we sample 5 frames at equal time intervals from these 50 frames. The modified foreground score (Equation 6) enables colors that are\nnot well explained by the background model to be classified as foreground, thus bootstrapping the\nforeground model. Once the pixel at location (ax, ay) from a new frame is classified using Equation\n7, the background and foreground models at the location (ax, ay) can then be updated with the new\nsample a. Samples from the previous 5 frames are maintained in memory as the\nforeground model samples. The label probabilities of the background/foreground from Equation 7\nare also saved along with the sample values for subsequent use in the Equations 3 and 4. One consequence of the update procedure described above is that when a large foreground object\noccludes a background pixel at (ax, ay) for more than 50 frames, all the background samples in the\nspatial neighborhood of (ax, ay) are replaced by these foreground samples that have very low P (bg|bi)\nvalues. This causes the pixel at (ax, ay) to be misclassified as foreground even when the occluding\nforeground object has moved away (because the background score will be extremely low due to the\ninfluence of P (bg|bi) in Equation 3). To avoid this problem, we replace the background sample from\nlocation (ax, ay) in the oldest frame in the background model with the new sample a from the current\nframe only if P (bg|a) estimated from Equation 7 is greater than 0.5. In our chosen evaluation data set, there are several videos with moving objects in the first 50 frames. The assumption that all these pixels are background is not severely limiting even in these videos. 2.2 Using MRF to clean the classification\nSimilar to , we use a Markov random field (MRF) defined over the posterior label probabilities of\nthe 4-neighbors of each pixel and perform the min-cut procedure to post-process the labels. The\ninteraction factor between the nodes was set to 1 for all our experiments. 3 Pixel-wise adaptive kernel variance selection\nBackground and foreground kernels. use the same kernel parameters for background and foreground\nmodels. Given the different nature of the two processes, it is reasonable to use different kernel\nparameters. Hence, it is useful to\nhave a larger spatial variance for the foreground model than for the background model. Optimal kernel variance for all videos. Variable kernel variance for a single video. Ideally, we would have different kernel variances for the water surface pixels and the rest\nof the pixels. Optimal kernel variance for classification. Having different variances for the background and\nforeground models reflects the differences between the expected uncertainty in the two processes. Assuming that the red\npoint (square) is a background sample and the blue point (triangle) is a foreground sample, having a\nvery low variance kernel (dashed red line) or a very high variance (solid red line) for the background\nprocess makes the background likelihood of the center point \u2018x\u2019 lower than the foreground likelihood. Thus, it is important to pick the optimal kernel variance for each process during classification. In order to address all four issues discussed above, we propose the use of location-specific variances. For each location in the image, a range of kernel variances is tried and the variance which results in\nthe highest score is chosen for the background and the foreground models separately. For each pixel location (ax, ay), the optimal variance for the background process is selected by\nmaximizing the score of the background label at sample a under different variance values:\n{\u03c3\u2217\nBd,ax,ay, \u03c3\u2217\nBrgb,ax,ay}=argmax \u03c3Bd,ax,ay,\u03c3Brgb,ax,aySB(a;\u03c3Bd,ax,ay , \u03c3Brgb,ax,ay ). A similar procedure may be followed for the foreground score. Ground truth for 20 frames in each video is provided with the data set. The F-measure is used to\nmeasure accuracy. The table shows the F-measure for each of the videos in the data set for various choices of\nthe kernel variances. The first 5 columns correspond to using a constant variance for each process at\nall pixel locations in the video. Comparing\ncolumns 2 and 3 shows that using a larger spatial variance for the foreground model than for the\nbackground model is beneficial. Using a selection procedure where the best kernel\nvariance is chosen from a set of values gives the best results for most videos (column 6) and frames. Comparison of our selection procedure to a baseline method of using a standard algorithm for variance\nselection in KDE (AMISE criterion) shows that the standard algorithm is not as accurate as our\n5method (column 7). For the color dimension, the choice is between little variation (B rgb=\n5/4), moderate variation (B rgb= 15/4), and high variation (B rgb= 45/4) for the background, and\nmoderate variation (F rgb= 15/4) for the foreground. These choices are based on our intuition about\nthe processes involved. For videos that differ significantly from the videos we use, it is possible that\nthe baseline AMISE method would perform better. We would like to point out that ideally the variance value sets should be learned automatically from a\nseparate training data set. In absence of suitable training data for these videos in particular and for\nbackground subtraction research in general, we resort to manually choosing these values. This also\nappears to be the common practice among researchers in this area. Benchmark comparisons are provided for selected existing methods - MOG, the complex foreground\nmodel (ACMMM03), and SILTP. Following the same procedure as ,\nany foreground 4-connected components smaller than a size threshold of 15 pixels are ignored. Due to use of an explicit foreground model, our kernel\nmethods misclassify most of the pixels as foreground and take a long time to recover from this error. Quantitative results in Table 3 compare the F-measure scores for our method against MoG,\nACMMM03, and SILTP results as reported by . We believe SILTP represents the state of the art\nin background modeling and hence compare our results to this method. For comparison, we use SILTP results\nfrom because in human judgement was used to vary a size threshold parameter for each video. We\nbelieve results from the latter fall under a different category of human-assisted backgrounding and\nhence do not compare to our method where no video-specific hand-tuning of parameters was done. Blue entries in Table 3 correspond to videos where our method performs better than SILTP. Use of color features that are more robust to illumination change, like LAB features in place of RGB\nhelps in successful classification of the shadow regions as background. By combining texture features with LAB\ncolor features, we expect to benefit from the strengths of both feature spaces. Augmenting the LAB features with SILTP features (computed at 3\nresolutions) in the VKS framework (VKS-lab+siltp) results in an improvement in 7 out of 9 videos\n(last column). The variance values used in our implementation are given in Table 2. Figure 4 highlights some key frames that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of\nour system versus the SILTP results. Use of color features helps\navoid these errors. Due to the\nexplicit modeling of the foreground, VKS is able to detect objects that stop moving. 6The two videos in the data set where our algorithm performs worse than SILTP are the Escalator\nvideo (rows g, h) and the Lobby video (rows i, j). One method to\naddress the situation is to observe the illumination change from one frame to the next. If more than\nhalf the pixels in the image change in illumination by a threshold value of TI or more, we throw away\nall the background samples at that instance and begin learning a new model from the subsequent 50\nframes. This method allows us to address the poor performance in the Lobby video with resulting\nF-measure values of 86.77 for uniform-rgb, 78.46 for VKS-rgb, and 77.76 for VKS-lab+siltp. The illumination change procedure does\nnot affect the performance of VKS on any other video in the data set. 5 Caching optimal kernel variances from previous frame\nA major drawback with trying multiple variance values at each pixel to select the best variance is\nthat the amount of computation per pixel increases significantly. In order to reduce the complexity\nthe algorithm, we use a scheme where the current frame\u2019s optimal variance values for each pixel\nlocation for both the background and foreground processes is stored (Bcache x,y , Fcache x,y ) for\neach location (x, y) in the image. When classifying pixels in the next frame, these cached variance\nvalues are first tried. The expensive variance selection procedure is\nperformed only at pixels where the resulting scores are close to each other. Algorithm 1 for efficient\ncomputation results in a reduction in computation in about 80\n6 Discussion\nBy applying kernel estimate method to a large data set, we have established, as do , that the use\nof spatial information is extremely helpful. Some of the important issues pertaining to the choice\nof kernel parameters for data sets with wide variations have been addressed. Using color features in the joint domain-range kernel estimation approach can complement complex\nbackground model features in settings where the latter are known to be inaccurate. Combining robust\ncolor features like LAB with texture features like SILTP in a VKS framework yields a highly accurate\nbackground classification system. For future work, we believe our method could be explained more elegantly in a probabilistic frame-\nwork where the scores are replaced by likelihoods and informative priors are used in the Bayes rule\nclassification. Using our selection procedure ( Column 6) results\nin the highest accuracy.",
        "Results and Findings": "In this work, we\nuse joint domain-range based estimates for background and foreground scores and\nshow that dynamically choosing kernel variances in our kernel estimates at each\nindividual pixel can significantly improve results. We combine these modeling improvements\nwith recently developed complex features and show significant improvements on a\nstandard backgrounding benchmark. These models that allow spatial influence from neighboring pixels have been\nshown to perform better than earlier neighbor-independent models. On applying our method to a data set with wide variations across the videos, we found that\nchoosing suitable kernel variances during the estimation process is very important. With various\nexperiments, we establish that the best kernel variance could vary for different videos and more\nimportantly, even within a single video, different regions in the image should be treated with different\nvariance values. We show that using location-\nspecific variances in addition to updating the model greatly improves background modeling. By combining color\nfeatures with SILTP features in our adaptive variance kernel model, we bring together the best ideas\nfrom both themes in the field and achieve state of the art results on a benchmark data set. 3.Incorporation of complex SILTP features into the joint domain-range kernel framework to\nachieve state of the art results. The paper is organized as follows. Results and comparisons are in\nSection 4. A similar equation holds for the foreground score:\nSF(a;\u03c3d\nF, \u03c3rgb\nF) =1\nNFNFX\ni=1G(argb\u2212firgb;\u03c3rgb\nF)\u00d7G(axy\u2212fixy;\u03c3d\nF)\u00d7P(fg|fi) (4)\nNF is the number of frames from which the foreground samples have been collected, F d and F rgb\nare the covariances associated with the foreground process. u is set to 106 and is set to 0.5 for our experiments. In the results section, we show that for a data set with\nlarge variations like , a single value for kernel variance for all videos is not sufficient to capture the\nvariability in all the videos. The figure also shows that while the medium kernel variance may be the\nbest choice for the first video, the low kernel variance may be best for the second video. (10)\nHere, B RB d and B rgb. However, in practice, it was found\nthat the variance selection procedure yielded large improvements when applied to the background\nmodel and little improvement in the foreground model. 4 Results\nFor comparisons, we use the data set which consists of 9 videos taken using a static camera in\nvarious environments. Our choice for the variance values for spatial dimension reflects no motion (B d\n= 1/4) and very little motion (B d = 3/4) for the background, and moderate amount of motion (F d\n= 12/4) for the foreground. To evaluate our results, the posterior probability of the background\nlabel is thresholded at a value of 0.5 to get the foreground pixels. Figure 3 shows qualitative results for the same frames that were reported by . We present results for\nour kernel method with uniform variances and adaptive variances with RGB features (Uniform-rgb\nand VKS-rgb respectively), and adaptive variances with a hybrid feature space of LAB color and\nSILTP features (VKS-lab+siltp). Except for the Lobby video, the VKS results are better than other\nmethods. Compared to the uniform variance kernel estimates,\nwe see that VKS-rgb has fewer false positive foreground pixels. The table shows that methods that share spa-\ntial information (uniform kernel and VKS) with RGB features give significantly better results than\nmethods that use RGB features without spatial sharing. Comparing the variable kernel method to\na uniform kernel method in the same feature space (RGB), we see a significant improvement in\nperformance for most videos. VKS\nwith RGB features (VKS-rgb) performs well in videos that have few shadows and lighting changes. Such a combination has\nproved useful in earlier work. We also compare our results (VKS-lab+siltp) to the 5 videos that were submitted as supplementary\nmaterial by . If the resulting scores are very far apart, then it is very likely that the pixel\nhas not changed its label from the previous frame. Dynamically adapting the variance for each pixel results in a significant increase in accuracy. 7Column num (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)\n4*B d\u2192 3 3 3 1 3 [1 3] AMISE\n4*B rgb\u2192 15 45 45 45 15 [5 15 45] AMISE\n4*F d\u2192 3 3 12 12 12 [12] [12]\n4*F rgb\u2192 15 45 45 45 15 [15] [15]\nAirportHall 40.72 59.53 67.07 63.53 47.21 70.44 53.01\nBootstrap 49.01 57.90 63.04 58.39 51.49 71.25 63.38\nCurtain 66.26 83.33 91.91 89.52 81.54 94.11 52.00\nEscalator 20.92 30.24 34.69 28.58 22.65 48.61 32.02\nFountain 41.87 51.89 73.24 74.58 67.60 75.84 28.50\nShoppingMall 55.19 60.17 64.95 62.18 63.85 76.48 70.14\nLobby 22.18 23.81 25.79 25.69 25.06 18.00 36.77\nTrees 30.14 58.41 73.53 47.03 67.80 82.09 64.30\nWaterSurface 85.82 94.04 94.93 92.91 94.64 94.83 30.29\nAverage 45.79 57.70 65.46 60.27 52.98 70.18 47.82\nTable 1: F-measure for different kernel variances. 8",

        "Abstract": "Enhancing Visual Representation Learning Through\nOriginal Image Utilization in Contrastive Learning\nAbstract\nContrastive instance discrimination techniques exhibit superior performance in\ndownstream tasks, including image classification and object detection, compared to\nsupervised learning. When we create a random crop of the original image (x) and force the model\nto make the two views similar to the original image (i.e., LeOCLR(Random original image)), the\nmodel performance decreases by 2.4%.",
        "Methodology": "However, a strong reliance on data augmentation during repre-\nsentation learning is a hallmark of these methods, potentially causing suboptimal\noutcomes if not meticulously executed. This practice\nmight diminish the quality of representation learning when two random crops\nencompass disparate semantic information. To counter this, we propose an inno-\nvative framework termed LeOCLR (Leveraging Original Images for Contrastive\nLearning of Visual Representations). This framework integrates a novel instance\ndiscrimination strategy and a refined loss function, effectively mitigating the loss\nof crucial semantic features that may arise from mapping different object segments\nduring representation learning. These augmentations are used to generate two altered\nviews (positive pairs) of the same instance, which are subsequently drawn closer in the latent space. The efficacy of these methods in acquiring meaningful representations\nhas been demonstrated through various downstream tasks, such as image classification and object\ndetection, serving as proxies for evaluating representation learning. Creating\npositive pairs via random cropping and subsequently prompting the model to align them based on\nshared information in both views poses an increased challenge to the SSL task, ultimately leading to\nan enhancement in representation quality. Moreover, random cropping followed by resizing guides\nthe model\u2019s representation to encompass object-related information across diverse aspect ratios,\nthereby promoting invariance to occlusions. When the model is compelled\nto align the representations of different parts of an object closer in the latent space, it may discard\ncrucial semantic features. This occurs because the model\u2019s representations are based on the shared\narea between the two views. Nevertheless, contrasting\npairs that might include diverse semantic information about the same object can be valuable, as it can\nfacilitate learning global features. The creation of random crops for a one-centric object does not ensure the acquisition of accurate\nsemantic pairs. Undesirable views containing different semantic content may be unavoidable when employing random\ncropping. Therefore, a method is needed to train the model on different parts of an object, developing\nrobust representations against natural transformations like scale and occlusion, rather than merely\npulling augmented views together indiscriminately. Addressing this issue is vital, as downstream task\nperformance relies on high-quality visual representations learned through self-supervised learning. Our work presents a new instance discrimination SSL approach designed to avoid compelling the\nmodel to create similar representations for two positive views, irrespective of their semantic content. As shown in Figure 2 (right) of the original paper, we incorporate the original image X into the\ntraining process, since it contains all the semantic features of the views X1 and X2. In our method, the\npositive pairs (i.e., X1 and X2) are drawn towards the original image X in the latent space, in contrast\nto contrastive state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches like SimCLR and MoCo-v2, which draw the two\nviews towards each other. This training method guarantees that the information in the shared region\nbetween the attracted views (X, X1) and (X, X2) is semantically accurate. Consequently, the model\nacquires enhanced semantic features by aligning with the appropriate semantic content, rather than\nmatching random views that might contain disparate semantic information. In essence, the model\nlearns representations of various object parts because the shared region encompasses correct semantic\ncomponents of the object. This contrasts with other methods that may discard vital semantic features\nby incorrectly mapping object parts in positive pairs. Our contributions are outlined as follows:\n\u2022We present a new contrastive instance discrimination SSL method, LeOCLR, created to\nminimize the loss of semantic features caused by mapping two semantically inconsistent\nrandom views. \u2022We establish that our method enhances visual representation learning in contrastive instance\ndiscrimination SSL, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques across a variety of downstream\ntasks. While all these techniques endeavor to approximate positive pairs in the\nlatent space, they employ distinct strategies to circumvent representation collapse. These methods bring the positive pairs closer while driving the negative\npairs apart in the embedding space, albeit through different mechanisms. SimCLR employs an\nend-to-end strategy where a large batch size is utilized for negative examples, and the parameters of\nboth encoders in the Siamese network are updated simultaneously. MoCo adopts a momentum\ncontrastive approach where the query encoder is updated during backpropagation, which subsequently\nupdates the key encoder. **Non-Contrastive Learning:** Non-contrastive techniques utilize solely positive pairs to learn\nvisual representations, employing a variety of strategies to prevent representation collapse. Techniques like BYOL and SimSiam utilize\nknowledge distillation methods, where a Siamese network comprises an online encoder and a target\nencoder. The target network\u2019s parameters are not updated during backpropagation. Instead, solely\nthe online network\u2019s parameters are updated while being encouraged to predict the representation of\nthe target network. The student network predicts a histogram of the features for\naugmented images, analogous to the teacher network\u2019s histogram. Instead, they utilize regularization to avoid representation collapse. The objective\nfunction of these techniques seeks to eliminate redundant information in the embeddings by aligning\nthe correlation of the embedding vectors closer to the identity matrix. While these techniques exhibit\nencouraging results, they possess limitations, including the sensitivity of representation learning to\nregularization and reduced effectiveness if certain statistical properties are absent in the data. However,\nwhen generating multiple cropped views from the same object instance, these views might contain\ndisparate semantic information. To tackle this issue, LoGo generates two random global crops and\nN local views. Simultaneously, they contend that different local views\npossess distinct semantic content, thus diminishing similarity among them. SCFS proposes a different\napproach for managing unmatched semantic views by searching for semantically consistent features\nbetween the contrasted views. CLSA generates multiple crops and applies both strong and weak\naugmentations, using distance divergence loss to enhance instance discrimination in representation\nlearning. Therefore, we aim to attract the two global views to the original (intact and uncropped) image, which\nfully encapsulates the semantic features of the crops. 3 Methodology\nThe mapping of incorrect semantic positive pairs, specifically those containing different semantic\nviews, results in the loss of semantic features, which in turn degrades the model\u2019s representation\nlearning. To address this, we propose a novel contrastive instance discrimination SSL strategy called\nLeOCLR. Our approach is designed to capture meaningful features from two random positive pairs,\neven when they encompass different semantic content, thereby improving representation learning. Achieving this necessitates ensuring the semantic correctness of the information within the shared\nregion between the attracted views. This is crucial because the selection of views dictates the\ninformation captured by the representations learned in contrastive learning. Given that we cannot\nguarantee the inclusion of correct semantic parts of the object within the shared region between the\ntwo views, we propose the inclusion of the original image in the training process. Our method, illustrated in Figure 3 (left) in the original paper, generates three views (X, X1, and\nX2). The original image (X) is resized without cropping, while the other views (X1 and X2) undergo\nrandom cropping and resizing. All views are then randomly augmented to prevent the model from\nlearning trivial features. We employ data augmentations akin to those used in MoCo-v2. The parameters of fk are updated using the formula:\n3\u03b8k\u2190m\u03b8k+ (1\u2212m)\u03b8q(1)\nwhere m is a coefficient set to 0.999, \u03b8qrepresents the encoder parameters of fq updated through\nbackpropagation, and \u03b8kdenotes the momentum encoder parameters of fk updated by \u03b8q. \u2113(u, v+) =\u2212logexp(u\u00b7v+/\u03c4)PPN\nn=0exp(u\u00b7vn/\u03c4)(2)\nwhere similarity is quantified by the dot product. The objective function amplifies the similarity\nbetween the positive pairs (u . \u03c4denotes the temperature hyperparameter of the softmax function. In our method, we augment the\nsimilarity between the original image\u2019s feature representation, u = fq(x), and the positive pair\u2019s feature\nrepresentation, v+ = fk(xi) (i = 1, 2), while driving apart all the negative examples (vn). This enables the model to capture semantic features from the two random views, even if they\ncontain different semantic information. Our technique captures improved semantic features compared\nto prior contrastive methods, as we ensure that the shared region between the attracted views contains\naccurate semantic information. Since the original image contains all segments of the object, any part\ncontained in the random crop is also present in the original image. Thus, when we draw the original\nimage and the two random views closer in the embedding space, the model learns representations\nof the different parts, creating an occlusion-invariant representation of the object across various\nscales and angles. This contrasts with earlier techniques, which draw the two views together in the\nembedding space regardless of their semantic content, leading to the loss of semantic features. Equation 3 and Algorithm 1 in the original paper highlight the primary distinctions between our\nmethod and prior multi-crop techniques, such as CLSA, SCFC, and DINO. The key differences are\nas follows:\n\u2022Previous methods assume that two global views contain identical semantic information,\nencouraging the model to concentrate on similarities and generate similar representations\nfor both views. In contrast, our method utilizes the original images instead of global\nviews, as we contend that global views may contain incorrect semantic information for the\nsame object. While they may aid in capturing certain global features, this could restrict\nthe model\u2019s capacity to learn more universally applicable semantic features, ultimately\nimpacting performance. \u2022Prior methods employ several local random crops, which might be time- and memory-\nintensive, while our method utilizes only two random crops. \u2022Our objective function employs different strategies to enhance the model\u2019s visual represen-\ntation learning. We encourage the model to align the two random crops with the original\nimage, which encompasses the semantic information for all random crops while avoiding\ncompelling the two crops to have similar representations if they do not share similar semantic\ninformation. This approach differs from prior methods, which encourage all crops (global\nand local) to have similar representations, regardless of their semantic content. 44 Experiments\nWe executed multiple experiments on three datasets: STL-10 \"unlabeled\", comprising 100,000\ntraining images, CIFAR-10, containing 50,000 training images, and ImageNet-1K, with 1.28 million\ntraining images. The model was trained\nusing the SGD optimizer, with a weight decay set to 0.0001, momentum at 0.9, and an initial learning\nrate of 0.03. The mini-batch size was configured to 256, and the model underwent training for up to\n800 epochs on the ImageNet-1K dataset. **Evaluation:** We employed diverse downstream tasks to assess LeOCLR\u2019s representation learning\nagainst leading SOTA approaches on ImageNet-1K: linear evaluation, semi-supervised learning,\ntransfer learning, and object detection. For linear evaluation, we adhered to the standard evaluation\nprotocol, where a linear classifier was trained for 100 epochs on top of a frozen backbone pre-trained\nwith LeOCLR. The ImageNet-1K training set was used to train the linear classifier from scratch, with\nrandom cropping and left-to-right flipping augmentations. In the semi-supervised setting, we fine-tuned\nthe network for 60 epochs using 1% of labeled data and 30 epochs using 10% of labeled data. **Comparing with SOTA Approaches:** We employed vanilla MoCo-v2 as a baseline for comparison\nwith our method across various benchmark datasets, considering our use of a momentum contrastive\nlearning framework. Furthermore, we benchmarked our method against other SOTA techniques on\nthe ImageNet-1K dataset.

As\nshown, our method surpasses all others, outperforming the baseline (i.e., vanilla MoCo-v2) by 5.1%. This lends credence to our hypothesis that while two global views can capture certain global features,\nthey may also encompass distinct semantic information for the same object (e.g., a dog\u2019s head\nversus its leg), which should be taken into account to enhance representation learning. Specifically, we utilize 1% and 10% of the labeled training\n5data from ImageNet-1K for fine-tuning, adhering to the semi-supervised protocol introduced in\nSimCLR. This can be attributed to\nLeOCLR\u2019s enhanced representation learning capabilities, particularly in comparison to other SOTA\nmethods. We adhere to the transfer learning procedures to identify optimal hyperparameters\nfor each downstream task. As shown in Table 3, our method, LeOCLR, surpasses all compared\napproaches on a variety of downstream tasks. This demonstrates that our model acquires valuable\nsemantic features, enabling it to generalize more effectively to unseen data in different downstream\ntasks compared to other techniques. Our method preserves the semantic features of the given objects,\nthereby enhancing the model\u2019s representation learning capabilities. Consequently, it is more effective\nat extracting crucial features and predicting correct classes on transferred tasks. As shown in Table 4, our method surpasses all compared\ntechniques. Moreover, we conduct studies on the benchmark datasets STL-10 and\nCIFAR-10 using a distinct backbone (ResNet-18) to assess the consistency of our approach across\nvarious datasets and backbones. We also compare our approach with\nvanilla MoCo-v2 by manipulating their data augmentation techniques to determine which model\u2019s\nperformance is more significantly affected by the removal of certain augmentations. In addition,\nwe experiment with different fine-tuning settings to evaluate which model learns better and faster. Furthermore, we adapt the attraction strategy and cropping method of the original image, as well as\ncompute the running time of our approach. 5.1 Different Contrastive Instance Discrimination Framework\nWe utilize an end-to-end framework in which the two encoders fq and fk are updated through\nbackpropagation to train a model with our approach for 200 epochs with a batch size of 256. Subsequently, we conduct a linear evaluation of our model against SimCLR, which also employs\nan end-to-end mechanism. As presented in Table 5, our approach outperforms vanilla SimCLR by\na substantial margin of 3.5%, demonstrating its suitability for integration with various contrastive\nlearning frameworks. We\npre-trained all the approaches for 800 epochs with a batch size of 256 on both datasets and then\nconducted a linear evaluation. Table 6: SOTA approaches versus LeOCLR on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 with ResNet-18. This suggests that our approach\nlearns improved semantic features, demonstrating greater invariance to natural transformations like\nocclusion and variations in object scales. Additionally, we compare the performance of CLSA with\nour approach, given that both perform similarly after 800 epochs (see Table 1). Note that the CLSA\napproach uses multi-crop (i.e., five strong and two weak augmentations), while our approach employs\nonly two random crops and the original image. To address concerns about the increased\ncomputational cost associated with training LeOCLR compared to MoCo V2, we include the training\ntime for both approaches in Table 7. We trained both models on three A100 GPUs with 80GB for\n200 epochs. This sensitivity necessitates further analysis comparing our approach to Moco-v2. These experiments\naim to explore which model learns better semantic features and produces more robust representations\nunder different data augmentations. As shown in Figure 4, both models are affected by the removal\nof certain data augmentations. However, our approach shows a more invariant representation and\nexhibits less performance degradation due to transformation manipulation compared to vanilla MoCo-\nv2. In contrast, our approach experiences a decrease of only 25 percentage points (from a\nbaseline of 71.7% to 46.6% with only random cropping). This indicates that our approach learns\n8improved semantic features and produces more effective representations for the given objects than\nvanilla MoCo-v2. This indicates that our approach is advantageous when the labeled data for\ndownstream tasks is limited. We also conducted an experiment\nwhere all views were attracted to each other. However, in our method, we avoid attracting the two\nviews to each other, enforcing the model to draw the two views toward the original image only\n(i.e., the uncropped image containing semantic features for all crops). For these experiments, we\npre-trained the model on ImageNet-1K for 200 epochs using the same hyperparameters employed\nin the main experiment. They also highlight the importance of leveraging the original image\nand avoiding the attraction of views containing varied semantic information to preserve the semantic\nfeatures of the objects. This performance reduction occurs because cropping the original image and compelling the model to\nattract the two views towards it increases the probability of having two views with differing semantic\ninformation, resulting in a loss of semantic features of the objects. This decline is attributed to the high likelihood of\nattracting two views containing distinct semantic information. Therefore, we train both our\napproach and the MoCo-v2 baseline from scratch on the COCO dataset to evaluate how our method\nmanages the discarding of semantic features in such datasets. We utilized identical hyperparameters\nas for ImageNet-1K, training the models with a batch size of 256 over 500 epochs. Subsequently, we\nfine-tuned these pre-trained models on the COCO dataset for object detection. This emphasizes that our method of avoiding the attraction of two distinct views is\nmore effective at preserving semantic features, even in a non-object-centric dataset. Our method reduces the loss of semantic features by including the original image\nduring training, even when the two views contain different semantic content. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrated the invariance and robustness of our approach across different downstream tasks, such\nas transfer learning and semi-supervised fine-tuning.",
        "Results and Findings": "Our empirical evaluations reveal that LeOCLR con-\nsistently enhances representation learning across a spectrum of datasets, surpassing\nbaseline models. Notably, LeOCLR exhibits a 5.1% improvement over MoCo-v2\non ImageNet-1K in linear evaluation and demonstrates superior performance in\ntransfer learning and object detection tasks compared to several other techniques. For random cropping to be effective and achieve occlusion invariance,\nthe shared area must convey the same semantic meaning in both views. Instance discrimination SSL techniques encourage the model to approximate positive pairs,\ni.e., two views of the same instance, in the latent space, irrespective of their semantic content. \u2022We show that our method consistently improves visual representation learning for contrastive\ninstance discrimination across multiple datasets and contrastive mechanisms. Despite the encouraging results, the mechanism by which these methods prevent\ncollapse remains not fully understood.

Additionally, we evaluated the learned features on smaller datasets, such as CIFAR, and fine-grained\ndatasets, using transfer learning.

        "Methodology": "However, standard adaptation techniques often\ndisrupt this crucial property, leading to a loss of performance and generalization\nability. We propose a novel method that leverages [1, 2] to maintain equivariance\nduring the adaptation process. Our approach incorporates a regularization term\nthat penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior, ensuring that\nthe adapted model retains its symmetry properties. This is achieved through a\ncarefully designed loss function that combines standard task-specific losses with\nan equivariance-preserving constraint. Large pretrained models, while powerful, often\nlose this crucial equivariance during adaptation to new tasks using standard techniques. This loss\ncan significantly impact performance and generalization. However, standard fine-tuning or transfer\nlearning methods often disrupt these inherent symmetries, leading to a degradation in performance\nand robustness. This is particularly problematic when dealing with large pretrained models, where the\ncomputational cost of retraining can be prohibitive. Furthermore, the loss of equivariance can lead to\nunpredictable behavior and reduced generalization capabilities, especially when the test data differs\nsignificantly from the training data in terms of transformations. This necessitates the development of\nnovel adaptation techniques that explicitly preserve equivariance. This paper addresses the challenge of adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while preserving\ntheir inherent equivariance. We introduce a novel method that leverages regularization techniques\nto maintain equivariance during the adaptation process. Our approach carefully balances the need\nto optimize for task-specific performance with the constraint of preserving the model\u2019s equivariant\nproperties. This is achieved through a carefully designed loss function that combines standard task-\nspecific losses with an additional term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior. The regularization term is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different types of transformations\nand model architectures. This allows our method to be applied to a wide range of problems and\nmodels. The key innovation lies in the formulation of the regularization term, which is derived from\nthe theoretical properties of equivariant functions and carefully tuned to avoid over-regularization. A comprehensive analysis of the impact of different hyperparameters on both\nperformance and equivariance provides valuable insights into optimal configurations for various\nscenarios. The ability to maintain equivariance during\nadaptation opens up new possibilities for deploying these models in applications where symmetry\nis paramount. Future research will focus on extending our method to more intricate scenarios and\nexploring its applications in diverse domains. We believe that our approach represents a significant\nstep towards developing more robust and reliable adaptation techniques for large pretrained models. While our method demonstrates substantial improvements in preserving equivariance, challenges\nremain. For instance, enforcing equivariance constraints can be computationally expensive, especially\nfor large models and complex transformations. Future work will focus on developing more efficient\nalgorithms to mitigate this computational burden. Furthermore, we plan to explore the application of\nour method to a broader range of tasks and datasets, further validating its generality and robustness. The potential for improving the efficiency and scalability of our method is a key focus for future\nresearch. However,\nthese methods often neglect the crucial aspect of preserving the inherent equivariance properties\nof the pretrained models. Our work directly addresses this limitation by explicitly incorporating\nequivariance constraints during the adaptation process. This contrasts with existing approaches that\nprimarily focus on optimizing task-specific performance without considering the potential loss of\nequivariance. Existing methods\noften fail to capture these symmetries effectively, leading to suboptimal performance and reduced\ngeneralization capabilities. Early work on equivariant neural networks focused on designing architectures that explicitly incor-\nporate symmetries into their structure. These architectures, while effective in specific\nscenarios, often lack the flexibility and scalability required for adapting large pretrained models. Our\napproach offers a more general framework that can be applied to a wider range of architectures and\ntransformations, without requiring significant modifications to the model structure. This flexibility\nis crucial for adapting large pretrained models, which often have complex and highly specialized\narchitectures. Recent research has explored the use of regularization techniques to encourage equivariance in\nneural networks. These methods typically involve adding penalty terms to the loss function that\npenalize deviations from the desired equivariant behavior. However, many of these approaches are\ncomputationally expensive or require significant modifications to the training process. Our method\noffers a more efficient and practical approach, leveraging a carefully designed regularization term that\ncan be easily integrated into existing training pipelines. The key innovation lies in the formulation\nof this regularization term, which is derived from the theoretical properties of equivariant functions\nand carefully tuned to avoid over-regularization. This ensures that the adapted model retains its\nequivariance properties without sacrificing performance on the downstream task. Furthermore, our work builds upon the growing body of research on incorporating inductive biases\ninto neural networks. Inductive biases, which encode prior knowledge about the problem domain,\nhave been shown to significantly improve the efficiency and generalization capabilities of neural\n2networks. Equivariance is a powerful inductive bias that can be leveraged to improve the performance\nof models on tasks with inherent symmetries. Our approach provides a principled way to incorporate\nthis inductive bias during the adaptation process, ensuring that the adapted model benefits from the\nprior knowledge encoded in the pretrained model while still adapting effectively to the new task. This\ncombination of leveraging pretrained knowledge and enforcing equivariance is a key contribution of\nour work. In summary, our work differs from existing approaches by explicitly addressing the preservation\nof equivariance during the adaptation of large pretrained models. We propose a novel method\nthat combines task-specific optimization with a carefully designed regularization term to maintain\nequivariance. This approach offers a flexible and efficient way to adapt large pretrained models\nwhile preserving their desirable properties, leading to improved performance and generalization\ncapabilities. Our work contributes to the growing field of equivariant neural networks and provides\na valuable tool for adapting these models to new tasks in various domains. The ability to maintain\nequivariance during adaptation opens up new possibilities for deploying these models in applications\nwhere symmetry is paramount. 3 Methodology\nThis section details the proposed method for equivariant adaptation of large pretrained models. Our\napproach leverages a novel regularization technique to maintain the model\u2019s inherent equivariance\nproperties during the adaptation process. The core idea is to augment the standard task-specific loss\nfunction with an additional term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior. This\nensures that the adapted model retains its symmetry properties while still achieving high performance\non the new task. The regularization term is carefully designed to be flexible and adaptable to\ndifferent types of transformations and model architectures, allowing for broad applicability. We\nachieve this flexibility by parameterizing the regularization term to account for various transformation\ngroups and their associated representations. This allows us to handle a wide range of symmetries,\nfrom simple translations and rotations to more complex transformations. The specific form of the\nregularization term is derived from the theoretical properties of equivariant functions, ensuring a\nprincipled approach to preserving equivariance. Furthermore, we employ techniques to prevent over-\nregularization, ensuring that the model\u2019s performance on the target task is not unduly compromised. The hyperparameters controlling the strength of the regularization are carefully tuned through cross-\nvalidation to find the optimal balance between equivariance preservation and task performance. The adaptation process begins by initializing the model with the weights of a pre-trained equivariant\nmodel. We then define a composite loss function that combines a standard task-specific loss (e.g.,\ncross-entropy for classification, mean squared error for regression) with our proposed equivariance-\npreserving regularization term. For instance, for translation equivariance,\nthe regularization term might penalize differences in the model\u2019s output when the input is translated. The choice of regularization term is crucial for the success of our method,\nand we provide a detailed analysis of different regularization strategies in the supplementary material. The entire process is optimized using standard gradient-based optimization techniques, such as\nstochastic gradient descent or Adam. A key aspect of our methodology is the careful selection and tuning of hyperparameters. These\nhyperparameters control the strength of the regularization term, the type of transformations considered,\nand other aspects of the adaptation process. We employ a rigorous hyperparameter search strategy,\nusing techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization, to identify the optimal configuration\nfor each dataset and task. The performance of the adapted model is evaluated using standard metrics,\nsuch as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, and mean squared error and\nR-squared for regression tasks. In addition to these standard metrics, we also evaluate the degree of\nequivariance preserved by the adapted model using quantitative measures. These measures assess\nhow well the model\u2019s output transforms according to the expected equivariance properties under\nvarious transformations. To mitigate this, we explore various optimization strategies,\nincluding efficient computation of the regularization term and the use of specialized hardware\naccelerators. We also investigate the use of approximation techniques to reduce the computational\nburden without significantly compromising the accuracy of the equivariance preservation. These\nstrategies are crucial for making our method scalable and applicable to a wide range of models and\ntasks. The efficiency of our method is a key focus of our experimental evaluation, and we provide a\ndetailed analysis of the computational cost and scalability of our approach. Furthermore, we explore\nthe trade-off between computational cost and the degree of equivariance preservation, providing\ninsights into the optimal balance for different scenarios. In summary, our methodology provides a principled and flexible framework for adapting large\npretrained models while preserving their equivariance properties. The key components are a carefully\ndesigned regularization term, a robust hyperparameter search strategy, and efficient optimization\ntechniques. The combination of these elements allows us to achieve high performance on downstream\ntasks while maintaining the desirable equivariance properties of the pretrained model. This approach\nopens up new possibilities for deploying large pretrained models in applications where symmetry\nplays a crucial role, such as image processing, physics simulations, and robotics. The flexibility and\nscalability of our method make it applicable to a wide range of models and tasks, paving the way for\nmore robust and reliable adaptation techniques in the future. The datasets selected encompass scenarios with varying levels\nof complexity in terms of the underlying symmetries and the difficulty of the downstream tasks. This allows for a comprehensive assessment of our method\u2019s performance across different scenarios\nand its robustness to variations in data characteristics. We compare our method against several\nstate-of-the-art adaptation techniques, including standard fine-tuning, transfer learning with various\nregularization strategies, and other methods designed to preserve specific types of equivariance. The experiments are designed to rigorously\nassess the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance and equivariance of the adapted\nmodels, providing valuable insights into the optimal configuration for various scenarios. We also\nanalyze the computational cost of our method and compare it to the computational cost of alternative\napproaches. Our experimental setup involves training several large pretrained models, including convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), on various datasets. For each dataset,\nwe consider different downstream tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and graph\nclassification. The pretrained models are chosen based on their suitability for the specific task and\ntheir inherent equivariance properties. The adaptation process involves fine-tuning the pretrained\nmodels using our proposed method, which incorporates an equivariance-preserving regularization\nterm into the loss function. The hyperparameters of our method, including the strength of the\nregularization term and the type of transformations considered, are carefully tuned using a grid search\napproach. The performance of the adapted models is evaluated using standard metrics appropriate\nfor the specific task, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, and\nmean squared error and R-squared for regression tasks. In addition to these standard metrics, we also\nevaluate the degree of equivariance preserved by the adapted models using quantitative measures. The computational cost\nof our method is comparable to other advanced techniques, indicating that the added benefit of\nequivariance preservation does not come at the expense of excessive computational overhead. Further\nanalysis reveals that the optimal hyperparameter settings vary depending on the specific dataset and\n4Method Accuracy Equivariance Score\nStandard Fine-tuning 0.85 0.60\nTransfer Learning 0.88 0.65\nMethod A [5] 0.90 0.70\nMethod B [6] 0.92 0.75\nOur Method 0.95 0.85\nTable 1: Comparison of our method with other state-of-the-art adaptation techniques on a benchmark\nimage classification dataset.

The\nrobustness of our method is also demonstrated by its consistent performance across different datasets\nand tasks, indicating its general applicability and potential for broad impact. The flexibility\nof our approach allows it to be applied to a wide range of models and tasks, making it a valuable\ntool for adapting large pretrained models in various domains. Future work will focus on extending\nour method to more complex scenarios and exploring its application in different domains, such as\nrobotics and physics simulations, where equivariance is crucial for reliable and robust performance. We also plan to investigate more efficient optimization strategies to further reduce the computational\ncost of our method, making it even more scalable and applicable to larger models and more complex\ntasks. The datasets were\nchosen to represent diverse domains and transformation groups, allowing for a comprehensive\nassessment of our method\u2019s robustness and generalizability. We considered various downstream tasks,\nincluding image classification, object detection, and graph classification, to demonstrate the broad\napplicability of our approach. The hyperparameters of our method were carefully tuned using a grid\nsearch approach to optimize performance and equivariance preservation. The improved equivariance score suggests that our method\nsuccessfully maintains the model\u2019s inherent symmetry properties during adaptation, leading to better\n5generalization and robustness. The superior accuracy indicates that our method does not compromise\ntask performance in the pursuit of equivariance preservation. Further analysis of the confusion\nmatrices revealed that our method significantly reduced misclassifications in challenging cases,\nparticularly those involving transformations of the input images. Here, we compare our method with standard\nfine-tuning and transfer learning, focusing on MSE and computational time. Our method achieves the\nlowest MSE (0.08), indicating superior predictive accuracy. While the computational time is slightly\nhigher (1800s) compared to standard fine-tuning (1200s), the significant improvement in accuracy\njustifies the increased computational cost. The increase in computational time is primarily due to\nthe additional computation required for the equivariance-preserving regularization term. However,\nthis overhead is manageable and does not significantly hinder the practicality of our method. Further\noptimization strategies, such as efficient computation of the regularization term and the use of\nspecialized hardware, could further reduce the computational cost.

The figure shows the model\u2019s output under various transformations\nof the input, highlighting the consistent and predictable changes in the output, which is a hallmark\nof equivariance. This visual representation complements the quantitative measures presented in\nTables 3 and 4, providing a more comprehensive understanding of our method\u2019s effectiveness. The\nsupplementary material also includes a detailed analysis of the impact of different hyperparameters\non both performance and equivariance, providing valuable insights into the optimal configuration for\nvarious scenarios.

Our approach leverages a carefully designed regularization\nterm that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior, ensuring that the adapted model\nretains its symmetry properties. The computational cost, while slightly higher than standard fine-tuning, is justified by the\nsignificant improvements in accuracy and equivariance. A key contribution of this work is the development of a principled and flexible framework for\nincorporating equivariance constraints during model adaptation. This framework allows for the\neffective utilization of the inductive biases encoded in pretrained models while still achieving high\nperformance on new tasks. The ability to maintain equivariance during adaptation is crucial for many\napplications, particularly in domains with inherent symmetries, where standard adaptation techniques\noften fail to capture these symmetries effectively.

The flexibility of our approach allows it to be applied to a wide range of models and tasks,\nmaking it a valuable tool for adapting large pretrained models in various domains. Future work will focus on several key areas. First, we plan to explore more efficient optimization\nstrategies to further reduce the computational cost of our method, making it even more scalable\nand applicable to larger models and more complex tasks. This includes investigating the use of\nspecialized hardware accelerators and approximation techniques to reduce the computational burden\nwithout significantly compromising the accuracy of equivariance preservation. Second, we will\nextend our method to more complex scenarios, such as adapting models to tasks with multiple types\nof transformations or incorporating more sophisticated representations of the transformation groups. Third, we will explore the application of our method to a wider range of tasks and datasets, further\nvalidating its generality and robustness. While our method demonstrates\nsignificant improvements in preserving equivariance during adaptation, there are still challenges\nto overcome. For instance, the computational cost of enforcing equivariance constraints can be\nsignificant, particularly for large models and complex transformations. Future work will focus on\ndeveloping more efficient algorithms to address this issue. Furthermore, the optimal hyperparameter\nsettings may vary depending on the specific dataset and task, requiring careful tuning for optimal\nperformance. Despite these limitations, our work represents a significant advancement in the field\nof model adaptation, providing a principled way to preserve equivariance while achieving high\nperformance. We believe that our approach will inspire further investigations into the interplay\nbetween equivariance, adaptation, and generalization in large pretrained models. The ability to\nmaintain equivariance during adaptation opens up new possibilities for deploying these models in\nvarious applications where symmetry plays a crucial role. This is\nparticularly important for applications where the underlying symmetries of the data are crucial for\naccurate and reliable predictions. We anticipate that our work will inspire\nfurther investigations into the interplay between equivariance, adaptation, and generalization in\nlarge pretrained models. The development of more efficient algorithms and the exploration of more\ncomplex scenarios will be key focuses of future research. The ability to effectively leverage the\ninductive biases encoded in pretrained models while adapting to new tasks is a crucial step towards\nbuilding more robust and reliable AI systems.",

We conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets,\ncomparing our approach against state-of-the-art adaptation techniques. Our evaluation focuses\non two key aspects: (1) performance on the target task, measured using standard metrics such as\naccuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification), and mean squared error (MSE), R-squared\n(for regression); and (2) preservation of equivariance, assessed using quantitative measures that\ncapture the consistency of the model\u2019s output under various transformations. Table 3 shows the results of our experiments on an image classification dataset. We compare our\nmethod against standard fine-tuning, transfer learning, and two other state-of-the-art equivariance-\npreserving adaptation methods (Method A [5] and Method B [6]). Our method achieves the highest\naccuracy (95%) and the best equivariance score (85%), significantly outperforming the other methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in preserving equivariance while achieving\nhigh performance on the target task. Table 4 presents the results on a regression task. Figure ?

        "Abstract": "Representation Transferability in Neural Networks\nAcross Datasets and Tasks\nAbstract\nDeep neural networks, which are built from multiple layers with hierarchical\ndistributed representations, tend to learn low-level features in their initial layers\nand shift to high-level features in subsequent layers. In addition, abstract\ntopics or architectures that are popular in one region may not be popular in the other.",
        "Methodology": "Transfer learning, multi-task\nlearning, and continual learning paradigms leverage this hierarchical distributed\nrepresentation to share knowledge across different datasets and tasks. 1 Introduction\nDeep networks, constructed with multiple layers and hierarchical distributed representations, learn\nlow-level features in initial layers and shift to high-level features as the network becomes deeper. Generic hierarchical distributed representations allow for the sharing of knowledge across datasets\nand tasks in paradigms such as transfer learning, multi-task learning, and continual learning. First, we demonstrate that the layer-wise\ntransferability between datasets or tasks can be non-symmetric, with features learned from a source\ndataset being more relevant to a target dataset, despite similar sizes. Third, we propose that the layer-wise\ntransferability of representations can be a proxy for measuring task relatedness. These observations\nemphasize the importance of curriculum methods and structured approaches to designing systems\nfor multiple tasks that maximize knowledge transfer and minimize interference between datasets or\ntasks. 2 Citation Networks\n2.1 Methods\nWe have produced a citation graph using citation data from NeurIPS papers from SemanticScholar,\nand institutional information about authors from AMiner. Unmatched papers were manually\nsearched for, with all but one being found in the Semantic Scholar database. For each paper, we used\nthe S2AG API to identify authors, and the authors of their references. We then marked institutes automatically by country\nname and common cities and regions in China. We supplemented automatic annotations with existing\nregional matchings and added 364 additional rules for regional matching. We also removed major\nmultinational corporate labs. Of the remaining 5422 papers, we removed papers that were not from\nChina, the US, or Europe, or included collaborators from multiple regions, leaving us with 1792\npapers. While 60% of the data set\ncomes from American papers, they only compose 34% of Chinese citations. American citations of\nChinese papers are even more dramatic, with the 34% of the dataset coming from Chinese papers only\naccounting for 9% of American citations. These numbers are even more significant when compared\nto American citations of European papers; we found that American institutions cite European papers\nmore often than Chinese papers despite our dataset containing six times more Chinese papers than\nEuropean. The separation between American and Chinese research is more pronounced than would be expected\nbased solely on regional preference. American and European research communities demonstrate\nsimilar citation patterns with few citations to Chinese papers. Chinese institutions, on the other hand,\ncite both American and European papers less than either of those regions. USA China Europe\nUSA 41 9 12\nChina 34 21 6\nEurope 15 9 14\nTable 1: Proportion of papers from given regions citing other regions or endogenously. Firstly, while we have labeled the work of any\nuniversity located in the United States as American, it is possible that such labs still have close ties to\nChina, leading to an underestimate of the divide between US and Chinese AI research. Secondly, we\nhave excluded papers where author information was not available on AMiner, a Chinese company,\nand therefore, there could be more Chinese papers in our dataset than we have determined. This separation impacts not only the research topics, but also how they evolve. The North American and Euro-\npean AI communities have begun to publish research on the ethics of AI and have included systems\n2for reviewers to flag ethical concerns and ask authors to provide ethics statements. Engagement\nwith Chinese researchers in this topic remains limited, even though ethics statements from Chinese\nAI institutions show many similarities to western ones. Although similar statements\nexist across regions, disagreements in research practice still arise. One such example is where Duke\nUniversity stopped using the Duke-MTMC dataset because researchers had not obtained consent\nfrom the students they collected images from, yet similar datasets like Market-1501 from China\ncontinue to be used. The divide between these two communities impacts individual researchers, the machine learning\ncommunity as a whole, and potentially the societies impacted by AI research, highlighting the need\nfor a discussion to overcome this barrier.",
        "Results and Findings": "This paper\nstudies the layer-wise transferability of representations in deep networks across\nseveral datasets and tasks, noting interesting empirical observations. Transferring high-level features, with the learning of low-level features, can also be useful when the\ntasks are similar but the data distributions differ slightly. This paper studies the layer-wise transferability of representations in deep networks across several\ndatasets and tasks, and reports some interesting observations. From the NeurIPS website, we first gathered\nall paper titles from 2012 to 2021.

        "Methodology": "By leveraging a\nself-instruction framework, the authors aim to overcome limitations in proprietary\nLLMs, such as GPT-3.5, by enabling open models to handle both seen and unseen\ntools in zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios. This approach addresses the critical\nneed for accessible and adaptable large language models capable of interacting with\nthe real world through diverse modalities. The proposed methodology focuses on\nenhancing the model\u2019s ability to understand and utilize tool descriptions, enabling\nseamless integration with a wide range of visual tools without requiring extensive\nretraining. This is achieved through a novel combination of prompt engineering\nand reinforcement learning techniques. This is a significant challenge, as current open-source LLMs often lack the\nsophisticated capabilities of their proprietary counterparts, such as GPT-3.5, particularly in handling\ncomplex interactions with external tools. Our approach focuses on bridging this gap by leveraging\na novel self-instruction framework. This framework allows these open-source models to learn to\nutilize a diverse range of tools, both seen and unseen, in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, thereby\nsignificantly expanding their functional capabilities. The key innovation lies in our ability to teach\nthe models to understand and interpret tool descriptions, enabling seamless integration with new tools\nwithout requiring extensive retraining. This is achieved through a carefully designed combination of\nprompt engineering and reinforcement learning techniques, which we detail in subsequent sections. The resulting system demonstrates a remarkable ability to generalize to unseen tools and tasks,\nshowcasing the robustness and adaptability of our approach. Our self-instruction framework addresses a critical need in the field of large language models: the\ndevelopment of accessible and adaptable models capable of interacting with the real world through\ndiverse modalities. Existing methods often rely on extensive fine-tuning or complex architectures,\nlimiting their applicability and scalability. In contrast, our approach emphasizes simplicity and\nefficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of open-source LLMs and tools. The modular design of\nour framework allows for easy integration of new tools and tasks, fostering a continuous improvement\ncycle driven by iterative instruction generation, model training, and performance evaluation. This\niterative process ensures that the model\u2019s capabilities are constantly refined and expanded, leading to\na more robust and versatile system. The core of our method involves generating a diverse and representative dataset of instructions and\ncorresponding tool usage examples. The use of reinforcement learning further enhances the model\u2019s ability to learn optimal\n.tool usage strategies, going beyond simple imitation learning to develop a deeper understanding of\nthe task and the tools available. This allows the model to not only execute tasks correctly but also\nto select the most appropriate tools for a given situation, demonstrating a level of strategic thinking\nnot typically observed in simpler approaches. The resulting system exhibits a remarkable capacity\nto adapt its tool usage strategies based on the specific requirements of the task, highlighting the\neffectiveness of our self-instruction framework. This\nunderscores the potential of open-source LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art results when equipped\nwith the right tools and training methodologies. Future work will focus on expanding the range of supported tools and tasks, exploring more sophis-\nticated reinforcement learning techniques, and investigating the incorporation of user feedback to\npersonalize the model\u2019s behavior. We also plan to explore the potential of incorporating uncertainty\nestimation into the model\u2019s decision-making process, allowing it to handle ambiguous situations\nmore effectively. The ultimate goal is to create a truly versatile and user-friendly system that empow-\ners users to leverage the power of open-source LLMs for a wide range of real-world applications,\ndemocratizing access to advanced AI capabilities. Early work focused primarily on integrating LLMs with specific tools,\noften requiring significant engineering effort for each new tool [3]. These approaches lacked the\ngenerality and adaptability needed for seamless integration with a diverse range of tools. Our work\nbuilds upon these efforts by proposing a self-instruction framework that enables LLMs to learn to\nutilize tools in a more generalizable manner. This contrasts with previous methods that often relied\non extensive fine-tuning or complex architectures, limiting their scalability and applicability. Our\napproach emphasizes simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of open-source\nLLMs and tools. The modular design of our framework allows for easy integration of new tools and\ntasks, fostering a continuous improvement cycle driven by iterative instruction generation, model\ntraining, and performance evaluation. Several recent studies have explored the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for tool use in LLMs [4,\n5]. These methods typically involve training an RL agent to select and utilize tools based on a reward\nsignal. However, these approaches often require significant amounts of labeled data or carefully\ndesigned reward functions, which can be challenging to obtain. Our self-instruction framework\naddresses these limitations by leveraging a combination of prompt engineering and RL, allowing the\nmodel to learn from a diverse set of instructions and tool usage examples without requiring extensive\nlabeled data. The iterative nature of our framework allows for continuous improvement, leading\nto more robust and adaptable tool usage strategies. Furthermore, our focus on open-source LLMs\ndistinguishes our work from previous studies that primarily focused on proprietary models. These methods typically involve generating a large dataset of instructions and corresponding\nresponses, which are then used to fine-tune the LLM. Our work extends this approach by incorporating\ntool usage into the self-instruction framework. This allows the model to learn not only to generate\nappropriate responses but also to select and utilize the appropriate tools for a given task. The\nintegration of tool usage into the self-instruction process is a key innovation that distinguishes our\nwork from previous studies. This allows for a more holistic approach to LLM training, leading to\nmore robust and versatile models. Our approach also relates to work on multi-modal learning [8, 9], which focuses on integrating\ndifferent modalities, such as text and images, into a unified framework. Our work bridges this gap by providing a framework for integrating LLMs with multi-modal tools,\nenabling them to perform complex tasks involving visual comprehension and image generation. The\nability to handle both seen and unseen tools in zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios is a key advantage\nof our approach. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, making it suitable for a wider\nrange of applications. By focusing on open-source LLMs and providing a simple, efficient, and scalable framework for\ntool integration, we aim to empower researchers and developers to build more powerful and versatile\nAI systems. The modular design of our framework allows for easy extension and customization,\nmaking it suitable for a wide range of applications and user needs. The ability to generalize to unseen\ntools and tasks is a crucial aspect of our approach, ensuring that the resulting systems are robust and\nadaptable to evolving requirements. 3 Methodology\nOur methodology centers on a self-instruction framework designed to empower open-source LLMs\nlike LLaMA, Vicuna, and OPT to effectively utilize multi-modal tools for visual comprehension\nand image generation tasks. This framework directly addresses the limitations of these open-source\nmodels compared to proprietary counterparts such as GPT-3.5, particularly in handling complex\ninteractions with external tools. The core of our approach lies in enabling these open-source models\nto handle both seen and unseen tools in zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios. This is achieved through\na novel combination of prompt engineering and reinforcement learning techniques, meticulously\ndesigned to enhance the model\u2019s understanding and utilization of tool descriptions. The framework\u2019s\nmodularity allows for seamless integration of a wide range of visual tools without extensive retraining,\na significant advantage over existing methods that often require substantial model re-adaptation for\neach new tool. This efficiency is crucial for scalability and broad applicability. The self-instruction process begins with the generation of a diverse dataset comprising instructions\nand corresponding tool usage examples. The diversity of the dataset is paramount in enabling the model to generalize effectively\nto unseen tools and tasks. The examples are designed to explicitly demonstrate the appropriate\nselection and application of tools for specific tasks, providing the model with clear guidance on how\nto leverage the tools effectively. This detailed instruction set is crucial for overcoming the limitations\nof simple imitation learning, allowing the model to develop a deeper understanding of the relationship\nbetween tasks, instructions, and tool usage. Reinforcement learning plays a crucial role in refining the model\u2019s tool usage strategies. We employ a\nreward function that incentivizes the model to select and utilize tools optimally, leading to improved\nperformance on the target tasks. The reward function is designed to consider both the correctness\nof the model\u2019s output and the efficiency of its tool usage. The iterative nature of\nthe reinforcement learning process allows for continuous improvement, leading to increasingly robust\nand adaptable tool usage strategies. This iterative refinement is key to achieving high performance on\na wide range of tasks. The training process involves iteratively generating new instructions and tool usage examples based\non the model\u2019s performance. This iterative approach allows the model to learn from its mistakes and\ncontinuously improve its understanding of tool usage. This human-in-the-loop approach ensures that the\nmodel is trained on high-quality data, leading to improved performance. This continuous improvement cycle is a key differentiator of our approach,\nleading to a more robust and versatile system. We assess the model\u2019s performance on both seen and unseen\ntools, evaluating its ability to generalize to new situations. Our experiments focus on evaluating\nthe model\u2019s performance across various visual tasks, including image captioning, visual question\nanswering, and image generation. We assess the model\u2019s ability to generalize to unseen tools\nand compare its performance to existing methods, particularly proprietary LLMs like GPT-3.5. The experimental design emphasizes the robustness and adaptability of our approach, highlighting\nits potential to bridge the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, efficiency, and generalization capabilities,\noffering a multifaceted assessment of the model\u2019s performance. The analysis focuses on\nidentifying the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, providing valuable insights for future\nresearch and development. The rigorous evaluation methodology ensures the\nreliability and validity of our results. The dataset is split into training,\nvalidation, and test sets, ensuring a robust evaluation of the model\u2019s performance. The training set is\nused to train the model using our self-instruction framework, while the validation set is used to tune\nhyperparameters and monitor the model\u2019s performance during training. The test set is used to evaluate\nthe final model\u2019s performance on unseen data. The dataset includes examples of both seen and\nunseen tools, allowing us to assess the model\u2019s ability to generalize to new tools. The diversity of the\ndataset is crucial for ensuring the robustness and generalizability of the model. The dataset is publicly\navailable to facilitate reproducibility and further research. The data collection process involved a\ncombination of automated generation and manual curation, ensuring the quality and relevance of the\ndata. The dataset is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for the incorporation of new tools and\ntasks in the future. For image captioning, we measure the BLEU score and ROUGE score to assess\nthe quality of the generated captions. For visual question answering, we measure the accuracy of the\nmodel\u2019s answers. For image generation, we use Inception Score (IS) and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance\n(FID) to evaluate the quality and diversity of the generated images. The model\u2019s ability to generalize to\nunseen tools is also evaluated, demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of our approach. The model\u2019s ability to generalize to unseen tools highlights\nthe robustness and adaptability of our approach. Further analysis reveals that the model\u2019s success is\nstrongly correlated with its ability to accurately interpret instructions and select appropriate tools. This underscores the importance of carefully designing the self-instruction framework to ensure\neffective knowledge transfer and generalization. The ultimate\ngoal is to create a truly versatile and user-friendly system that empowers users to leverage the power\nof open-source LLMs for a wide range of real-world applications.

The training set\nwas used to train the model using our self-instruction framework, while the validation set was used\nfor hyperparameter tuning and monitoring performance during training. The test set was used for\nevaluating the final model\u2019s performance on unseen data, including examples with both seen and\nunseen tools. This rigorous evaluation methodology ensured the reliability and validity of our results,\ndemonstrating the model\u2019s ability to generalize to new and unseen tools and tasks. The dataset\u2019s\ndiversity was crucial for ensuring the robustness and generalizability of the model\u2019s performance. For image captioning, we measured the BLEU and ROUGE scores to assess the quality of the\ngenerated captions. For visual question answering, we measured the accuracy of the model\u2019s answers. For image generation, we used the Inception Score (IS) and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) to\nevaluate the quality and diversity of the generated images. Furthermore, the performance on unseen tools was\nremarkably close to that on seen tools, highlighting the model\u2019s strong generalization capabilities. This highlights the importance of the careful\ndesign of our self-instruction framework in ensuring effective knowledge transfer and generalization. The consistent performance across different tasks and the strong generalization to unseen tools\ndemonstrate the robustness and adaptability of our approach. Future work will focus on expanding the\nrange of supported tools and tasks, exploring more sophisticated reinforcement learning techniques,\nand investigating the incorporation of user feedback to personalize the model\u2019s behavior.

In this scenario, there is no training\ninvolved, only inferences that are recursively applied. The subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 provides a concise\noverview of the inpainting feature and the feedback loops in generative AI. This particular scenario has not been explored in previous studies, to the best of our knowledge.",
        "Methodology": "This recursive application can result in images that are either similar to or vastly different from the original,\ndepending on the removed sections and the model\u2019s ability to reconstruct them. This concept is also being explored in the context of recursively training generative AI models with\ntheir own generated data. These AI models are capable of producing text, audio, images, and video, finding applications in a wide array of\ntransformative uses. For LLMs,\nnumerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate their knowledge across different subjects, their proficiency in solving\nmathematical or reasoning problems, and their language comprehension. These metrics aim to quantify how closely generated images resemble real ones and how effectively\nthey cover the spectrum of real images. In this process, the AI tool is provided with an image containing missing parts and is tasked\nwith filling them in to complete the image. This has consequences for newer AI models, as they are frequently trained on data gathered from the\nInternet, establishing a feedback loop where new models are trained using data created by earlier AI models. This cycle can result in\ndiminished performance or even the breakdown of AI models, prompting research into the stability of AI models when trained using\ntheir own generated data. The feedback loops in generative AI that have been examined thus far pertain to the training of newer models, creating a loop across\ndifferent generations of AI models. For instance, when the input to the AI model is an image and the output is also an image, as is the case\nwith inpainting, the AI model can be recursively applied to its own output, forming a loop. Examining the effects of these recursive applications of the AI model on the\ngenerated content is essential to determine whether the AI models remain stable or degrade, similar to what occurs in the training\nloop.In this research, we examine the inference feedback loop utilizing a renowned AI image model, Stable Diffusion, and its inpainting\nfeature. A thorough empirical investigation is carried out to discern the conditions under which the model maintains stability and\nwhen it experiences degradation. Various metrics are available to assess the resemblance between the original image and the one reconstructed\nthrough inpainting. These range from traditional methods like Structural Similarity (SSIM) and multi-scale SSIM (MS-SSIM), which\nare based on pixel-level comparisons, to more sophisticated methods like Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) and\nPaired/Unpaired Inception Discriminative Score (P/U-IDS), which employ AI models to simulate human-like perceptual evaluations. This can result\nin a decline in the effectiveness of AI models, or even their failure, when they are trained using data they have produced themselves. This has sparked a growing interest in determining the circumstances under which these generative AI models maintain stability\nwhen trained recursively with data they generate. The stability is influenced by multiple factors, such as the specific model, the\nquantity of AI-generated data used in each retraining cycle, and whether the cycle involves one or multiple AI models. In all these investigations, the recursive aspect involves training new AI models with data produced by\nother AI models. However, in certain situations, recursion can happen when the same AI model is used solely for making inferences. This process begins with an image, to which a mask is applied to obscure certain areas, and inpainting is utilized to fill in\nthese areas. The procedure is then reiterated\nusing a different mask to produce a subsequent image, this time entirely generated from AI-produced content. The process continues\nas inpainting is recursively applied to images that have already undergone inpainting. As parts of the images are removed and\nreconstructed, information is inevitably lost. However, it is crucial to determine whether this loss leads to images that are drastically\ndifferent from the original, or if the images become simpler and less intricate. Similar to the recursive training of models with their\nown data, it is important to understand the conditions under which inpainting remains stable or degrades under recursion. The consequences of recursive inpainting are influenced by numerous factors, including the specific AI model employed, the\ncharacteristics of the image, and the masks utilized in each iteration. The masks applied at each stage. The number of iterations. Specifically, we employed a version of Stable Diffusion 2 that was fine-tuned\nfor inpainting. The model\u2019s parameters were kept at their default\nsettings. We did not use any text prompts to direct the inpainting, allowing the model to concentrate on reconstructing the missing\nparts based solely on the remaining visual information without any textual guidance. 2For the image selection, to minimize any potential bias, we randomly chose images from an extensive dataset containing over 81,000\nart images of various types created by different artists. From this dataset, 100 images were randomly picked to form our evaluation\nset. The input images are 512x512 pixels; if their original aspect ratio is not square, blank areas are added to the sides to achieve the\n512x512 format. In generating masks for inpainting, we divide the images into squares of a predetermined size. In each iteration, a square is randomly\nchosen to serve as the mask. To facilitate comparisons across different mask and image sizes, our experiments use the number of\npixels inpainted relative to the image size as the primary parameter, rather than the number of inpainting operations. To assess the similarity to the original image across iterations, we employ the Learned Perceptual Image Path Similarity (LPIPS)\nmetric, which is frequently used to evaluate inpainting quality. In our implementation, we utilize the features from three neural\nnetworks to calculate the metric: SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG. We conducted recursive inpainting, altering 400% of the pixels, using masks of sizes 64x64, 128x128, and 256x256. To measure the\ndegradation as inpainting operations are performed, we calculated the LPIPS metric between the original image and each subsequent\ngeneration using the features from the three neural networks (SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG). The bars represent the standard deviation observed across the samples for each\ndata point. As the recursive inpainting progresses, the distance from the original image increases, potentially leading to an image that bears\nno resemblance to the original. The rate at which the distance increases tends to decrease, but it does not appear to stabilize even\nwhen the distance becomes substantial. The significant standard deviation indicates\nthat different images will exhibit varying behaviors. To gain a better understanding of the variability in distances for each image, scatter plots of the LPIPS distances for the 100 images\nfor each neural network are presented. Among the three\nnetworks (SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG), VGG shows the fewest outliers. Given that VGG is the most complex network, it\nis expected to capture the image features more effectively. To investigate whether the degradation is consistent across different runs, we selected 10 images from the set of 100 and performed\n10 runs on each. The LPIPS metrics across these runs for three different images are displayed, using the VGG network, which\ngenerally exhibits the lowest deviations. It is noticeable that variations are more significant with larger masks, which is anticipated\nsince larger masks require fewer iterations to reach a given percentage of inpainting, thus introducing more variability. The variations\nalso decrease as the percentage of inpainting increases, indicating that a higher number of inpainting operations leads to reduced\nvariability. This suggests that recursive inpainting tends to converge in terms of LPIPS distance as the process advances. This issue is currently a focal point in the research community. Consequently, this paper introduces a new dimension to the study of the effects of recursive application of generative AI, specifically\nin the inference phase. This can enhance current research endeavors and offer deeper insights into the underlying causes of collapse,\npotentially leading to advancements in AI models that can lessen the adverse effects of recursion. Developing theoretical models that can account for these effects is also a crucial area for future research. Additionally, exploring the connections between recursive training and recursive inpainting could provide valuable insights.",
        "Results and Findings": "Inpainting performance can be measured\nby removing parts of an image, using the model to restore them, and comparing the result with the original. This study investigates the effects of recursive inpainting on Stable Diffusion, a widely\nused image model. The findings indicate that recursive inpainting can result in image degradation, ultimately\nleading to a meaningless image, and that the final outcome is influenced by factors such as the image type, the size\nof the inpainting areas, and the number of iterations. These tools have garnered widespread public interest, attracting hundreds of millions of users. These AI tools have reached exceptional performance levels in various tasks, making their evaluation a crucial aspect. These benchmarks facilitate model comparisons, and when\na new model is launched, its performance on these standard benchmarks is typically reported. Assessing the quality of content produced by AI is crucial not only for comparing different AI models or evaluating their progress\nin specific tasks but also because the extensive use of generative AI is altering the fundamental nature of content found on the\nInternet. AI-generated texts and images are now widespread and, in some instances, predominant, with this trend expected to\npersist in the coming years. The constraints of our assessment, along with the findings, are deliberated in\nSection 5. Generally, inpainting can only restore a portion of the information that is lost in the missing\nimage segments. This results in a second image that has been partially generated by the AI image model. In the subsequent section, we outline\nthe results of an extensive empirical investigation into recursive inpainting using Stable Diffusion, representing an initial effort to\nidentify the primary factors that influence the effects of recursive inpainting. The AI model used. Several initial observations can be drawn from these results:\n1. The three networks used for\ncomputing the LPIPS (SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG) yield comparable results. It is evident that there is considerable variability across images, but the general trends are\nconsistent with those observed in the mean: the distance increases with more inpainting and with larger masks. Consequently, we will only report results for VGG moving forward,\nalthough all metrics are available in the repository along with the images. The findings\nreveal that recursion can result in the deterioration and eventual breakdown of the image, a phenomenon akin to the model collapse\nobserved when training generative AI models with their own data.",

        "Abstract": "Fast Vocabulary Transfer for Language Model\nCompression\nAbstract\nReal-world business applications require a trade-off between language model\nperformance and size. ADE.",
        "Methodology": "We propose a new method for model compression that relies\non vocabulary transfer. We evaluate the method on various vertical domains and\ndownstream tasks. Because larger LMs, on average, exhibit higher accuracy, a common trend\nhas been to increase the model\u2019s size. However, these models\u2019 superior performance comes at the cost of a steep\nincrease in computational footprint, both for development and for inference, ultimately hampering\ntheir adoption in real-world business use-cases. For one thing, despite being tremendously cheaper than their\nbigger cousins, fine-tuning, deploying and maintaining large numbers of such models (one for each\ndownstream task) soon becomes too expensive. Furthermore, latency and/or hardware requirements\nmay limit their applicability to specific use-cases. Recently, several attempts have been made to make these models smaller, faster and cheaper, while\nretaining most of their original performance. The teacher-student framework requires that both the teacher and the student estimate the same\nprobability distribution. In this work, we explore a method for further reducing an LM\u2019s size by compressing its vocabulary\nthrough the training of a tokenizer in the downstream task domain. In particular, moving from word to subword- level, the tokenization solves two\nproblems: vocabulary explosion and unknown words. Moreover, the capability to tokenize text\neffectively in any domain is key for the massive adoption of pre-trained general-purpose LMs fine-\ntuned on downstream tasks. Indeed, tokenizers are still able to process out-of-distribution texts at the\ncost of producing frequent word splits into multiple tokens. However, the language varies significantly in vertical domains or, more generally, in different topics. Hence, ad-hoc tokenizers, trained on the domain statistics, may perform a more efficient tokenization,\nreducing on average the length of the tokenized sequences. This is important since compact and\nmeaningful inputs could reduce computational costs, while improving performance. Indeed, memory\nand time complexity of attention layers grows quadratically with respect to the sequence length.Furthermore, a vertical tokenizer may require a smaller vocabulary, which also affects the size of the\nembedding matrix, hence further reducing the model\u2019s size. Following this intuition, we propose a V ocabulary Transfer (VT) technique to adapt LMs to in-domain,\nsmaller tokenizers, in order to further compress and accelerate them. This technique is complementary\nto the aforementioned model compression methods and independent of the type of tokenizer. As a\nmatter of fact, we apply it in combination with KD. After reviewing related works in Section 2, we present the\nmethodology in Section 3, we then outline the experiments in Section 4 and draw our conclusions in\nSection 5. The obtained\nmodel, called DistilBERT, is a smaller version of BERT, with the same architecture but half the layers,\ntrained to imitate the full output distribution of the teacher (a pre-trained BERT model). Both the versatility of the subword-\nlevel tokenization, and the constraints imposed by the teacher- student framework (same output\ndistribution), discouraged such investigations. (2021) presented an approach\nfor transferring the vocabulary of an LM into a new vocabulary learned from new domain, with the\npurpose of boosting the performance of the fine-tuned model. To the best of our knowledge, we are\nthe first to study VT in the scope of model compression. More specifically, a tokenizer is a function\nthat maps a textual string into a sequence of symbols of a given vocabulary V. LetTbe a tokenizer\nassociated with a vocabulary Vand a string s, we have T:s\u2192(t1, . These symbols, which define the LM\u2019s vocabulary, are statistically\ndetermined by training the tokenizer to learn the distribution of a dataset. For the reasons discussed\nearlier, a vocabulary Vin specialized on Din itself better fits the language distribution than Vgen. Thus, VT aims to initialize Vin by re-using most of the information learned from the\nLM pre-trained on Dgen. Once the new tokenizer Tin has been trained on the in-domain dataset Din\nusing a given vocabulary size, Tin will be different from the LM\u2019s tokenizer Tgen. Our objective is to transfer most of the information from Vgen into Vin. To this end, we first define a\nmapping between each symbol in Vin and a set of symbols in Vgen. Then, we define an assignment\ncriterion, based on the mapping, to obtain the embeddings for the tokens of Tin. Whenever a token is in Vinbut not in Vgen, VIPI calculates all the partitions\nof the new token with tokens from Vgen, then takes the minimal partitions and finally averages them\nto obtain an embedding for the new token. Instead of calculating all tokenizations, FVT uses a\nstraightforward assignment mechanism, whereby each token ti\u2208Vinis partitioned using Tgen. Indeed, in case ti\u2208Vin\u2229Vgen,\nEquation (2) falls back to Equation (1). Once embeddings are initialized with FVT, we adjust the model\u2019s weights by training it with MLM\non the in-domain data before fine-tuning it on the downstream task. We observed this trend as well during\npreliminary experiments, therefore we kept such a tuning stage in all our experiments. As a baseline model, we also implement a method called Partial V ocabulary Transfer (PVT), whereby\nonly the tokens belonging to both vocabularies ti\u2208Vin\u2229Vgenare initialized with pre-trained\nembeddings, while unseen new tokens are randomly initialized. 3.1 Distillation\nVT can be combined with other model compression methods like quantization, pruning and KD. For\nsome of the methods, the combination is trivial, since they have no impact on the vocabulary. KD,\nhowever, requires the vocabularies of the student and teacher to be aligned. Hence, its integration\nwith VT is non-trivial. Accordingly, we set up a KD procedure with VT, in order to determine the\neffects of applying both VT and KD to an LM. However,\nunlike the original setup, we do not remove the token-type embeddings and pooler. after distilling the\nstudent on Dgen, we further distil the student using Din. However, instead of adapting the teacher\nbefore the second distillation, we simply distil the student a second time on the in-domain dataset. Our choice of applying VT after KD is based on findings by Kim and Hassan (2020), that different\ninput embedding spaces will produce different output embedding spaces. Hence, if VT were to be applied first to the\nstudent, its input embedding space would differ greatly from that of the pre-trained teacher during\ndistillation. We then define four vocabulary\nsizes for retraining our tokenizers. Specifically, we take the original vocabulary size and define it\nas a vocabulary size of 100 percent. We subsequently reduce this size to 75percent, 50percent, and\n25percent, From now on, we will refer to such tokenizers as T100, T75, T50, T25 respectively, while\nthe original vocabulary will be called Tgen. 3Models are fine-tuned for 10 epochs with early stopping on the downstream task. We set the initial\nlearning rate to 3\u00d710\u22125and batch size to 64 for each task. The sequence length is set to 64 for ADE\nand CoNLL03 and 128 for LEDGAR. Each configuration is repeated 3 times with different random\ninitializations. MLM is performed for one epoch. Domain-specific words are\nusually split into multiple tokens, yielding longer sequences and breaking the semantics of a word\ninto multiple pieces. An example is shown in Figure 2. Tgen is the generic\ntokenizer (BERT cased), the same in each corpus, while T percent are the tokenizers trained in the\nvertical domain itself. A pre- trained language model fine-tuned on the task\n(Tgen) is compared with models having differently sized in-domain tokenizers (T100, T75, T50, T25)\nadapted by transferring information with FVT or PVT. Crucially, this guarantees a full exploitation of FVT in the scope of language\nmodel compression. Either way, FVT achieves a remarkable 15\nFurthermore, the reduced input length enabled by in-domain tokenization brings a reduction in\ninference time. The more a language is specialized, the higher is the speedup with in-domain\ntokenizers. In CoNLL03 instead where language is much less specialized,\nspeedup reduces and even disappears with T25. Distillation further pushes compression and speedup\nin any benchmark and setup, up to about 55\nIn summary, depending on the application needs, VT enables a strategic trade-off between compres-\nsion rate, inference speed and accuracy. One of the\nfactors that greatly contribute to a model\u2019s inference speed and memory footprint is vocabulary size. VT has been recently proposed for improving performance, but never so far in the scope of model\n5Table 5: The first row (Tgen) reports absolute values of the LM fine-tuned on the downstream task\nwithout VT or KD. An analysis conducted on various downstream tasks, application domains,\nvocabulary sizes and on its possible combination with knowledge distillation indicates that FVT\nenables a strategic trade-off between compression rate, inference speed and accuracy, especially, but\nnot only, in more specialized domains. Importantly, FVT appears to be orthogonal to other model\ncompression methods.",
        "Results and Findings": "Our results indicate that vocabulary transfer can be effectively\nused in combination with other compression techniques, yielding a significant\nreduction in model size and inference time while marginally compromising on\nperformance. For all these reasons, significant efforts - in both\nacademic and industry-driven research - are oriented towards the designing of solutions to drastically\nreduce the costs of LMs. Our experiments show that VT achieves an inference speed-up between x1.07 and x1.40, depending\non the downstream task, with a limited performance drop, and that a combination of VT with KD\nyields an overall reduction up to x2.76. The paper is organized as follows. Even in domain adaptation, the vocabulary was kept the same. Recently, Samenko et al. . . . . Hence, the vocabulary of the tokenizer determines how words in a text are split, whether as words,\nsub-words, or even characters. MLM eases adaptation and has\nalready been found to be beneficial in (Samenko et al., 2021). Our distillation consists of two steps. Its tokenizer is composed of 28996 wordpieces. The dataset is annotated with 100 different\nmutually-exclusive labels.

        "Abstract": "API with a Rich Linguistic Resource\nAbstract\nThis paper introduces a novel Python API, incorporated within the NLTK library,\nthat facilitates access to the FrameNet 1.7 lexical database.",
        "Methodology": "The API enables pro-\ngrammatic processing of the lexicon, which is organized by frames, and annotated\nsentences. This freely available and linguistically comprehensive\nresource encompasses more than 1,000 semantic frames, 10,000 lexical senses, and 100,000 lexical\nannotations embedded within corpus sentences. It has served as a foundational element for extensive\nresearch in natural language processing, particularly in the area of semantic role labeling. While the resource is largely navigable on the web, some\ndetails pertaining to linguistic descriptions and annotations are not easily accessible through the\nHTML data views. This API is integrated into recent versions of the widely-used NLTK suite and grants access to nearly\nall of the information within the FrameNet release. NLTK offers cross-platform functionality\nand is compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.x environments. It is also included in the\nAnaconda and Enthought Canopy Python distributions, which are frequently utilized by data scientists. In an active NLTK setup (version 3.2.2 or later), the FrameNet data can be downloaded through a\nsingle method call:\n>>> import nltk\n>>> nltk.download(\u2019framenet_v17\u2019)\nThe data will be installed under the user\u2019s home directory by default. Note that Frame-to-frame\nrelations include mappings between individual frame elements. These mappings are not exposed in\nthe HTML frame definitions on the website but can be explored visually via the FrameGrapher tool\non the website. Our API does not display these relations directly in the frame display but rather via\nindividual frame relation objects or the fe_relations() method, as discussed in Section 4.4. These relationships create the conceptual framework necessary to understand\ncertain meanings of vocabulary items. An Avenger (who might or might not be the same as the Injured_party)\nattempts to impose a Punishment on the Offender. The FEs within a frame are formally enumerated, along with a description of their role within the\nframe. Frames are connected in a network, which includes a hierarchy where one frame inherits from\nanother, and other frame-to-frame relationships. FrameNet\u2019s LUs include both content and function words, linking a lemma to a\nframe. Sentences are annotated with regard to frame-\nevoking tokens and the spans of their FEs. These displays\nshow users how to access object attributes they might not otherwise be aware of. The API uses lazy data structures to load XML files only as\nrequired, storing all loaded data in memory for quick subsequent access. 4.2 Lexicon Access Methods\nThe primary methods for accessing lexicon data are:\n\u2022frames(name) : returns all frames matching the provided name pattern. \u2022frame(nameOrId) : returns a single frame matching the name or the ID\n\u2022lus(name, frame) : returns all lexical units matching the provided name pattern. \u2022lu(id) : returns a lexical unit based on its ID\n2\u2022fes(name, frame) : returns all frame elements based on the name pattern provided\nMethods with plural names use regular expressions to search entries. These methods return lists of elements,\nand if no arguments are provided, they return all entries of the lexicon. Two extra methods are available for frame lookups: frame_ids_and_names(name) gets a mapping\nfrom frame IDs to names and frames_by_lemma(name) returns all the frames that have LUs\nmatching the provided name pattern. For instance:\n>>> f = fn.frame(\u2019Revenge\u2019)\n>>> f.keys()\ndict_keys([\u2019cBy\u2019, \u2019cDate\u2019, \u2019name\u2019, \u2019ID\u2019, \u2019_type\u2019, \u2019definition\u2019,\n\u2019definitionMarkup\u2019, \u2019frameRelations\u2019, \u2019FE\u2019, \u2019FEcoreSets\u2019,\n\u2019lexUnit\u2019, \u2019semTypes\u2019, \u2019URL\u2019])\n>>> f.name\n\u2019Revenge\u2019\n>>> f.ID\n347\nThe API provides user-friendly displays for important object types, presenting their contents in an\norganized manner. These displays indicate attribute names in square brackets. An Avenger performs a Punishment on a Offender as a consequence of an earlier action by the Offender, the Injury. The Avenger inflicting thePunishment need not be the same as the Injured_Party who suffered the Injury, but the Avenger does have to share the judgment that the Offender\u2019s action was wrong. Frames are organized in a network through different frame-to-frame relations. Each relation includes mappings between corresponding FEs of the two frames. Within a\nframe relation object, mappings between FEs are stored in the feRelations attribute. Semantic types provide added semantic labels for FEs, frames, and LUs. The method propagate_semtypes() propagates the semantic\ntype labels to other FEs using inference rules derived from FE relations. The semtypes() method\nreturns all semantic types, semtype() returns a specific type, and semtype_inherits() checks if\ntwo semantic types are in a subtype-supertype relationship. 4.5 Corpus Access\nFrame annotations of sentences are accessible through the exemplars andsubCorpus attributes of\na LU object or using the following methods:\n\u2022annotations(luname, exemplars, full_text)\n\u2022sents()\n\u2022exemplars(luname)\n\u2022ft_sents(docname)\n\u2022doc(id)\n\u2022docs(name)\nTheannotations() method returns a list of frame annotation sets. These sets comprise a frame-\nevoking target in a sentence, the LU in the frame, the FEs found in the sentence, and the status of any\nnull-instantiated FEs. Corpus sentences are accessed in two forms: exemplars() gives sentences with lexicographic\nannotations, and ft_sents() gives sentences from full-text annotations. Each sentence object has several annotation sets, the first is for sentence\nlevel annotations, the following for frame annotations. [2]\nbut it is only now that they have begun to find him out . \" In the future, we intend\nto include support for valence patterns, along with improved capabilities for annotation querying, and\nbetter syntactic information displays for FE annotations. Moreover, it is worth investigating whether\nthe API can be modified to work with other language FrameNets, also to support cross-lingual\nmappings.",

        "Methodology": "This approach aims to enhance\ndetection performance, reduce transmission costs, and handle temporal misalign-\nment effectively. Instead of transmitting entire\nfeature maps for each frame, FFNet computes a compact representation of the\nchanges in features between consecutive frames. This approach aims to enhance detection performance, reduce transmission costs, and handle\ntemporal misalignment effectively. The core innovation lies in leveraging the inherent temporal\ncoherence present in consecutive frames of a video stream. Instead of transmitting the entirety of\nfeature maps for each frame, FFNet computes a compact representation of the changes between\nconsecutive frames, termed \"feature flow.\" By focusing on these dynamic aspects, FFNet significantly\nreduces the data transmission volume, thereby mitigating bandwidth limitations. Furthermore, the robustness to temporal asynchrony is a key advantage, allowing for\nreliable operation even with delays and jitter inherent in real-world communication channels. Firstly, a feature extraction module processes\ninput frames to generate high-dimensional feature maps. These maps are then fed into a flow\nestimation module, which computes the optical flow between consecutive frames. This optical flow\nfield is subsequently used to warp features from the preceding frame, aligning them with the current\nframe\u2019s features. This difference is then compressed using a learned compression scheme,\ncarefully designed to minimize information loss while maximizing the compression ratio. The\nselection of an appropriate compression algorithm is critical to balancing the trade-off between data\nreduction and preservation of essential information for accurate object detection. The compressed feature flow is transmitted to a central processing unit (CPU), where it\u2019s used to\nupdate the feature maps from the previous frame. This updated feature map then serves as input\nfor the object detection process. This\nresilience to asynchrony is a significant advantage over methods requiring strict synchronization. The\nproposed method is rigorously evaluated on a large-scale VIC3D dataset, demonstrating substantial\n.improvements in detection accuracy and communication efficiency compared to baseline methods\nthat transmit raw data or full feature maps ? Further validation of FFNet\u2019s robustness to temporal asynchrony is provided through extensive exper-\niments involving varying levels of delay and jitter in the simulated communication channel. Future work will explore extensions to handle more complex scenarios, such as\nocclusions and varying weather conditions ?. Early approaches focused on transmitting raw\nsensor data, such as point clouds or images, directly to a central processing unit for processing ?. Subsequent work explored the\nuse of compressed sensing techniques to reduce the amount of data transmitted ?, but these methods\noften introduce significant information loss, leading to a degradation in detection performance. Furthermore, the synchronization requirements of these methods can be stringent, making them less\nrobust to temporal asynchrony. More recent research has investigated the use of feature maps instead of raw data for transmission. These methods typically involve extracting features from sensor data at the edge and transmitting\nthese features to a central server for object detection. While this approach reduces the amount of data\ntransmitted compared to transmitting raw data, it still requires significant bandwidth, especially for\nhigh-resolution sensor data. Moreover, the sensitivity to temporal misalignment remains a challenge. Several works have explored techniques for improving the robustness of feature-based methods to\ntemporal asynchrony, such as using temporal smoothing filters or predictive models ?. However,\nthese methods often introduce computational overhead and may not be effective in scenarios with\nsignificant delays or jitter. Our work differs from previous approaches by focusing on transmitting only the changes in features\nbetween consecutive frames, rather than the entire feature maps. This approach, based on the\nconcept of feature flow, significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted while\nmaintaining high detection accuracy. Existing methods that utilize optical flow for object tracking\nor video compression typically operate on pixel-level data or low-level features. In contrast, FFNet\noperates on high-level features extracted from a deep convolutional neural network, allowing for\na more robust and efficient representation of the scene dynamics. This allows for a more compact\nrepresentation of the scene changes, leading to significant bandwidth savings. The use of learned compression schemes further distinguishes our approach. Unlike traditional com-\npression methods that rely on generic compression algorithms, FFNet employs a learned compression\nscheme specifically tailored to the characteristics of feature flow. This allows for a better balance\nbetween compression ratio and information preservation, leading to improved detection performance. Furthermore, the adaptive nature of the compression scheme allows for dynamic adjustment of the\ncompression parameters based on the available bandwidth and desired detection performance. This\nadaptability is crucial in dynamic communication environments where bandwidth availability can\nfluctuate significantly. The proposed method offers a significant improvement in both efficiency and robustness\ncompared to existing approaches. 3 Methodology\nThe proposed Feature Flow Net (FFNet) framework addresses the challenges of temporal asynchrony\nand limited bandwidth in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection by trans-\nmitting compressed feature flow instead of raw data or full feature maps. This approach leverages the\ntemporal coherence inherent in video streams, focusing on the dynamic changes between consecutive\nframes rather than transmitting redundant information. The feature extraction module employs a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), such as\nResNet or EfficientNet, to process input frames and generate high-dimensional feature maps. The choice of CNN architecture is crucial for balancing computational\ncomplexity and feature representation quality. The\noutput of this module is a sequence of feature maps, one for each frame in the video stream. The flow estimation module computes the optical flow between consecutive feature maps. This is\nachieved using a deep learning-based optical flow estimation network, such as FlowNet or PWC-Net. This optical flow is then used to warp the features from the\nprevious frame to align them with the current frame. This warping step is crucial for accurately\nrepresenting the changes in features, as it accounts for the motion of objects in the scene. The feature flow is then compressed using a learned compression\nscheme, which is trained to minimize information loss while maximizing compression ratio. The compressed feature flow is then transmitted to the central processing unit. At the central processing unit, the received compressed feature flow is decompressed and used to\nupdate the feature maps from the previous frame. This updated feature map is then used for object\ndetection using a suitable object detection network. The robustness of FFNet\nto temporal asynchrony is a key advantage, allowing for reliable operation even with delays and\njitter inherent in real-world communication channels. The entire process, from feature extraction to\nobject detection, is optimized for efficiency and robustness, making FFNet a suitable solution for\nresource-constrained environments. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets,\nwith a ratio of 70:15:15. We used standard metrics for evaluating object detection performance,\nincluding precision, recall, F1-score, and mean Average Precision (mAP). The experiments were\ndesigned to assess the impact of different factors on FFNet\u2019s performance, including the choice of\n3CNN architecture for feature extraction, the optical flow estimation method, the compression scheme,\nand the level of temporal asynchrony. Our baseline methods included transmitting raw sensor data (point clouds), transmitting full feature\nmaps extracted from a pre-trained CNN, and a state-of-the-art method for compressed sensing-based\ndata transmission. We\nused a variety of hyperparameters for each component of FFNet, including the learning rate, batch\nsize, and network architecture, and selected the optimal hyperparameters based on the validation\nset performance. The training process involved minimizing a loss function that combined the\nreconstruction loss of the compression scheme and the object detection loss. FFNet achieved a mAP of 88.5\nTo evaluate the robustness of FFNet to temporal asynchrony, we introduced varying levels of delay\nand jitter into the simulated communication channel. This adaptive compression scheme allows FFNet\nto adjust its parameters based on the available bandwidth and desired detection performance, making\nit suitable for dynamic communication environments. The dataset was split into\ntraining, validation, and testing sets (70:15:15 ratio). Standard object detection metrics (precision,\nrecall, F1-score, mAP) were employed. Our baseline methods included transmitting raw sensor data (point clouds), transmitting full feature\nmaps from a pre-trained CNN, and a state-of-the-art compressed sensing-based method. Experiments were performed on a high-performance computing cluster\nwith multiple GPUs. Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, network architecture) was\nperformed using the validation set. The training process minimized a loss function combining the\ncompression scheme\u2019s reconstruction loss and the object detection loss. To assess FFNet\u2019s robustness to temporal asynchrony, we introduced varying levels of delay and\njitter into a simulated communication channel. Baseline methods, however, showed a significant\nperformance drop with increasing asynchrony. This adaptive compression scheme\nallows FFNet to adjust parameters based on available bandwidth and desired detection performance,\nmaking it suitable for dynamic communication environments. Unlike traditional approaches that transmit raw data or full\nfeature maps, FFNet leverages the temporal coherence within video streams by transmitting only the\ncompressed changes in features between consecutive frames \u2013 the \"feature flow.\" Each module plays a crucial role in optimizing the overall\nperformance. The choice of pre-trained CNN for feature extraction, the deep learning-based optical\nflow estimation network, and the carefully designed learned compression scheme all contribute to\nthe system\u2019s effectiveness. The adaptive nature of the compression scheme allows for dynamic\nadjustment of compression parameters based on available bandwidth and desired accuracy, further\nenhancing the system\u2019s adaptability to varying communication conditions. Investigating more sophisticated compression techniques and exploring the integration of other sensor\nmodalities, such as LiDAR and radar data, could further enhance the performance and robustness of\n5the system. The development of more efficient and robust optical flow estimation methods tailored\nto the specific characteristics of feature maps is also an area of ongoing research. The modular design and adaptive compression scheme provide flexibility\nand adaptability, making FFNet a versatile and powerful tool for addressing the challenges of data\ntransmission in resource-constrained environments.",

This revelation led us to explore the relationship\nbetween transformer architecture and the migratory patterns of flamingos, which in turn influenced our\ndecision to use a dataset comprised of 90% jellyfish recipes and 10% sonnets written by extraterrestrial\nbeings. The efficacy of this approach was evident in the significant reduction of grammatical errors\nin our model\u2019s output, which decreased by a factor of 3.14, the same numerical value as the ratio of\ncheese to wine in a traditional French fondue. This\nhypothesis was confirmed by the results, which showed a 25% increase in the model\u2019s performance on\na test set consisting entirely of palindrome sentences. Interestingly, this improvement was correlated\nwith a significant decrease in the model\u2019s power consumption, which we attributed to the reduced\nnumber of hamster wheels required to generate the necessary electricity.

        "Abstract": "The Significance of Fillers in Textual Representations\nof Speech Transcripts\nAbstract\nThis paper investigates the role of fillers within text-based representations of speech\ntranscripts. 1 Introduction\nThis paper addresses the critical role of disfluencies, specifically fillers, in spoken language processing.",
        "Methodology": "This\nis further shown through improvements in downstream tasks like predicting a\nspeaker\u2019s stance and their expressed confidence. While prior research has demonstrated the efficacy of contextualized embeddings pre-trained on\nwritten text for adapting to smaller spoken language corpora, these models typically exclude fillers and\ndisfluencies in pre-processing. Existing methods for analyzing fillers primarily\nrely on handcrafted features. In this work, we explore the use of deep contextualized word\nrepresentations to model fillers. We assess their value in spoken language tasks without relying on\nmanual feature engineering. The core motivation of this study stems from the following observations: First, fillers are essential\nto spoken language. Therefore, we intend to validate these observations by exploring how to efficiently represent fillers\nautomatically. To generate contextualized word embeddings\nfor fillers, we use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), given its state-\nof-the-art performance in several NLP tasks and its enhanced ability to integrate context compared to\nWord2Vec. This\ninvolves masking some input words at random and then attempting to predict those masked tokens. In our case, this method will be used to\nfine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on a spoken language corpus. Each experiment involves a token\nrepresentation strategy iand a pre-processing strategy Si. The token representation strategies are essential for our goal of learning the distribution of fillers\nusing BERT. The three token representation strategies are outlined as follows: T1involves no special\nprocessing for the fillers and BERT is left to use its prior understanding of fillers to model language. InT2, \"uh\" and \"um\" are marked with specific filler tags to distinguish them from other tokens, with\neach filler represented as separate tokens. This strategy encourages BERT to learn new embeddings\nthat emphasize filler context and position. In T3, both fillers are represented as the same token,\nindicating that they carry the same meaning. InS1, all\nfillers are removed from the sentences during both training and inference. For each combination of pre-processing and token representation strategies, we fine-tune\nBERT using the Masked Language Model objective like the original BERT paper. If fine-tuning is\nnot performed the training data of S1andS2are equivalent. 2.1.3 Confidence and Sentiment Prediction\nIn tasks of confidence prediction and sentiment analysis, our objective is to use BERT\u2019s text rep-\nresentations, which include fillers, to predict a confidence/sentiment label. We add a Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP) to BERT, which may have been fine-tuned using MLM. The MLP is trained by min-\nimizing the mean squared error (MSE) loss. These experiments adopt the same token representation\nand pre-processing techniques discussed in Section 2.1.1. The movies were rated between\n1 (most negative) and 5 stars (most positive). The videos were annotated for high-level attributes\nsuch as confidence, where annotators rated from 1 (not confident) to 7 (very confident). Similarly,\nsentiment was scored by annotators between 1 (strongly negative) to 7 (strongly positive). (3) The sentiment/stance polarity was clearly defined\nby choosing only reviews that were rated with 1-2 or 5 stars for annotation purposes. The confidence labels are the root mean square (RMS) values of labels\ngiven by 3 annotators. The sentiment labels are the average of the 3 labels. We examine language model (LM) perplexity using various\npre-processing strategies, using a fixed token representation strategy of T1. By keeping fillers during both training and inference, the model reaches a\nlower perplexity, with a reduction of at least 10%. Additionally, even without\nfine-tuning, S3outperforms S1andS2by reducing perplexity when fillers are used. This implies that\nBERT has prior knowledge of spoken language and uses the fillers. Consequently, fillers can reduce uncertainty of BERT for SLM. This is not an intuitive outcome; one\nmight assume that removing fillers during training and inference would decrease perplexity. The\nfact that S3exceeds other preprocessing methods shows that the Masked Language Model (MLM)\nprocess effectively learns this filler information. Given the limited data and high BERT embedding dimensionality\n(768), retaining existing representations with T1is better than learning representations from the\nscratch. Interestingly, T2andT3perform similarly. The hypothesis is that the difference between\n\"uh\" and \"um\" lies only in the duration of the pause, which cannot be captured in text. We fine-tune BERT using a filler to determine where the model believes the fillers most likely reside. Given a sentence S with length L, we introduce a mask token after the word j and obtain S*. We then\ncompute the probability of a filler in position j+1. Specifically, we calculate P([MASK=filler] | S), as depicted in Figure 1. Then, we plot the average\nprobability of the masked word being a filler given its sentence position in Figure 2. The fine-tuned\nBERT model with fillers predicts a high probability of fillers occurring at the beginning of sentences. This pattern is consistent with filler distribution in the dataset. The fine-tuned BERT without fillers,\npredicts constant low probabilities. Given that we only know sentence boundaries we still manage\nto observe that the model captures a similar positional distribution of fillers that are found in other\nworks.

In this work, we present data that suggests fillers play a role in predicting\na speaker\u2019s expressed confidence and their stance. S2has a higher MSE,\npossibly due to the mismatch between training and test datasets. In the subsection 3.1, we\nobserve that including fillers reduces MLM perplexity. An assumption is that that downstream tasks\nwould also benefit from the inclusion of fillers. We also propose and compare several token representation\nand pre-processing strategies for integrating fillers.",
        "Results and Findings": "Furthermore, pre-trained word embeddings trained on written text\nhave shown poor performance in representing spontaneous speech words like \"uh,\" as their meaning\nvaries significantly in spoken contexts. Second, research has connected fillers and prosodic cues to a speaker\u2019s Feeling of Knowing (FOK)\nor expressed confidence, signifying a speaker\u2019s commitment to a statement. We also investigate the best filler representation strategies for Spoken Language Modeling\n(SLM) and examine the learned positional distribution of fillers. Table 1 gives a concrete example of this process. Additionally, sentence\nmarkers are transcribed, with fillers at sentence beginnings if they occur between sentences. The results in Table 2(a)\ncompares S1, S2 and S3. Best token representation: The results presented in Table 2(b) reveal that T1outperforms other\nrepresentations when fine-tuning. Considering\nthese results, T1is fixed as the token representation strategy in all subsequent experiments. Learned positional distribution of fillers: We further test our model\u2019s learning of filler placement. Highlighted results exhibit significant differences\n(p-value < 0.005). We plan to extend these results to consider\ncombining textual filler-oriented representations with acoustic representations, and to further analyze\nfiller representation learned during pre-training.",

A concise review of essential details and notation will be provided. The\nauthors of these defenses are thanked for making their source code and pre-trained models accessible.

The\nnotion that soil can be seen as a form of living, breathing entity, with its own metabolism, its own\nrhythms, and its own patterns of growth and decay, is a notion that challenges traditional notions of\nsoil as a mere inert substance, and invites a more dynamic, perhaps even animistic, understanding\n2of the soil-scape as a complex, interconnected web of relationships and processes. Furthermore, the analysis of soil has been informed by the\nstudy of archaeology, where the examination of soil-related artifacts and relics has revealed the ways\nin which soil can be seen as\n3 Methodology\nThe notion of flamenco dancing on Wednesdays has led to a plethora of intriguing discoveries\nregarding the viscosity of soil samples, which, in turn, has prompted an investigation into the\nmigratory patterns of butterflies in relation to the soil\u2019s water-holding capacity. The procurement of soil samples from various geographical locations, including the moons of Jupiter\nand the lost city of Atlantis, has necessitated the development of novel methods for categorizing\nand analyzing these specimens. This, in turn, has led to the development of\nnovel methodologies for communicating with the soil, including a complex system of hand gestures,\ninterpretive dance, and the use of an ancient, long-forgotten language that is rumored to hold the\nsecrets of the universe. This, in turn, has led to the development of novel methodologies for soil-based\ntherapy, including soil-meditation, soil-yoga, and soil-based mindfulness practices. This, in turn, has led to the development of\nnovel methodologies for communicating with the soil, including a complex system of hand gestures,\ninterpretive dance, and the use of an ancient, long-forgotten language that is rumored to hold the\nsecrets of the universe.

It aims at applying computer vision algorithms to agricultural pattern\nrecognition from high-resolution aerial images. 2 Related Work\nThis section reviews\n3 Methodology\nThis section details of In this section, we elaborate on the given datasets, the pre-processing method,\nthe proposed deep learning-based framework, and the test-time augmentation (TTA) strategy. It contains 94,986 aerial\nfarmland images collected throughout 2019 across the U.S. Each image has a size of 512 \u00d7512 pixels\nand has 4 channels (RGB and NIR). Although the amount of the given training data is considerable, we still generate more data following\nthe data augmentation scheme of the winner solution last year. They conducted an image mosaic\n.scheme to enable the model to have multi-scale views during the training. To fit the model input\nsize, we create two new datasets using mosaicked images with down-sampling 2X (2 times) and\ndown-sampling 3X. The down-sampling dataset has the same image size of 512 \u00d7512 pixels that the\nrecognition model can share the same network architecture among 1X, 2X, and 3X imagery. To tackle the unbalance issue, we try to\nsample more images in the few-shot classes. Unlike other cumbersome decoders, SegFormer\u2019s decoder adopts MLP layers to aggregate multi-scale\nfeature outputs from different layers. Therefore, SegFormer is suitable for this\nchallenge due to the model size parameter limit of 150M.

        "Abstract": "Equivariant Adaptation of Large Pretrained Models\nAbstract\nThis paper explores the adaptation of video alignment to improve multi-step infer-\nence.",
        "Methodology": "Specifically, we first utilize VideoCLIP to generate video-script alignment\nfeatures. Due to the substantial disparity among specific tasks, the integration of multimodal input, and the\ncomplexity of multi-step inference, this is still a challenging task. Several studies have been proposed to address this task. Moreover, attention mechanisms are leveraged to anchor question-\nrelevant information in instructional videos. Additionally, they substitute BERT with XL-Net for text encoding. To alleviate the negative effects of modalities unalignment, in this paper, we leverage pretrained\nvideo-text models to achieve instructional video-text alignment, facilitating a more robust grounding\nof question-relevant knowledge for multi-step inference. We build the pipeline with four steps:\nInstructional Video Alignment, Question-Aware Grounding, Multimodal Context Reweighting and\nMulti-Step Inference. Specifically, we employ pretrained VideoCLIP for generating video-script\nalignment features, which are beneficial to cross-modal grounding. Subsequently, we anchor the\nquestion-relevant content in instructional videos by the combination of hard and soft grounding. Afterwards, we leverage additive attention to adjust the weighting of the multimodal context to\nemphasize the salient features. We\nreduce the proportion of teacher forcing linearly to bridge the gap between training and inference,\nwhich boosts the multi-step inference. Given an instructional video, which contains numerous frames and scripts, AI assistant extracts\nrelevant information from the video in accordance with the user \u02d82019s question q. We concatenate\n.these clips to form the visual function sequence as [F v 2 , ..., F v 1 , F v m] and the textual function\nsequence as [F t 1, F t 2, ..., F t m], where F v i comprises all frames of the i-th function \u02d82019s clip,\nand F t i contains all script sentences of the i-th function \u02d82019s clip. To adapt AI assistant to the\nuser\u02d82019s view, following previous work, we mask the referenced button related to candidate answers\nin user images U , denoted as bk. 3 Method\nIn this section, we will introduce the details of our method. Our method consists of four steps:\nInstructional Video Alignment, Question-Aware Grounding, Multimodal Context Reweighting and\nMulti-Step Inference. Next, to represent each function within the videos, we utilize the pretrained visual transformer from\nVideoCLIP to process the embeddings generated by S3D in each function. Then, we apply average\npooling over the processed sequence of embeddings to form the video embedding Vi corresponding\nto a given visual function F v i . For the text part, we use the pretrained textual transformer of\nVideoCLIP to encode the scripts of a textual function F t i . Similarly, we employ average pooling to\naggregate the processed sequence of text, generating the text embedding Ti of a given textual function\nF t i . Besides, we also utilize VideoCLIP to encode the questions q, the answer ai j and the masked button\nimage bk. We duplicate the images 30 times to ensure consistent video encoding. Specifically, we leverage three grounding mechanisms: soft, hard and\ncombined grounding. And, it uses another attention\nnetwork to compute the similarity between the question feature Q and the text feature sequence [T1,\nT2, ..., Tm]. Instead of relying on deep learning methods, hard\ngrounding follows previous work, which uses TF-IDF model to calculate the similarity between the\nquestion q and each textual function F t i from textual function sequence [F t 1, F t 2, ..., F t m]. Then, it uses the similarities as the weights to compute the averages of the video feature sequence\n[V1, V2, ..., Vm] and the text feature sequence [T1, T2, ..., Tm], respectively. Then, the two features from\ntwo grounding methods are averaged. Specifically, we utilize the gate network to fuse\nthe candidate answer feature Ai j with the corresponding button feature Bk, which generates the\nmultimodal answer feature \u02d802c6Ai j. We concatenate these multimodal contexts into a sequence [V ,\nT, Q, \u02d802c6Ai j] for each candidate answer. Finally, the fused feature is processed using a two-layer MLP to obtain the\ncandidate answer context feature C i j. 23.4 Multi-Step Inference\nOwing to the requirement for multi-step guidance in order to respond to the given questions, it is\nessential for models to perform multi-step inference. Specifically, we feed the\nprevious hidden state H i \u02d822121 and the contextual features C i j of candidate answers in Ansi into\nthe GRU. Then, the resulting current hidden state H i j for each candidate answer in Ansi is utilized\nto predict the correct answer in the i-th step. We adopt a two-layer MLP and the softmax function\non the concatenated current hidden states [H i 1, H i 2, ..., H i n] to generate the probability of the\ncorrect answer. Cross entropy is used to compute the loss. This causes a huge gap between training\nand inference. To bridge this gap, we reduce the reliance on teacher forcing linearly. In other words,\nwe choose the hidden state of the most probable answer predicted by models as the historical state of\nthe next step H i, when a sample is selected for autoregressive training. 4 Experiments\n4.1 Dataset and Implementation Details\nWe use AssistQ train@22 and test@22 sets to train and validate. In our experiments, we use Adam optimizer with a learning rate 10 \u02d822124. The batch size is set to 16,\nthe maximum training epoch is 100, and we adopt early stopping. This superiority can be attributed to our utilization of a video-text\naligned pretrained encoder for feature extraction. The aligned features are beneficial to multi-step\ninference. Furthermore, our method exhibits improved performance when the results are ensembled.

This is because\nteacher forcing is beneficial in preventing models from accumulating mistakes during the early stages\nof training. Subsequently, we identify and highlight question-relevant content\nwithin instructional videos. To further improve the overall context, we assign weights to emphasize\nprominent features.

        "Results and Findings": "Then, we reweight the multimodal context to emphasize prominent features. Despite the advancements\nachieved through these techniques, all of them adopt the unaligned pretrained encoders to extract\nvisual and textual features, leading to significant semantic gaps between modalities, thereby hindering\nbetter results. Then, it deduces\nthe correct answer ai j based on the image U as perceived by the user, from the candidate answer set\nAnsi = ai 1, ai 2, ..., ai n in i-th step. Following previous work, we segment the video into several clips\nbased on scripts. Each clip illustrates one specific function of the device in video. 3.1 Instructional Video Alignment\nTo align the videos and the text for better cross-modal understanding, we leverage pretrained Video-\nCLIP to generate the features of instructional videos. For the video part, we initially utilize pretrained\nS3D to generate an embedding for each second of the video, with a frame rate of 30 frames per second. Soft grounding adopts the similarity from two attention networks to perform a weighted\naverage of the two feature sequences, respectively. Due to the varying importance of different context features\nin determining the correct answers, we utilize additive attention to reweight the multimodal context\nand get the fused feature. And we test our model on the\nAssistQ test@23 dataset. We randomly select 5\n4.2 Performance Evaluation\nWe present the performance evaluation on the test dataset in Table 1a.

Reweighting Mechanism We show the result of the model without attention reweighting in Table 3a. We observe a considerable decrease in performance for the model lacking attention reweighting. We find that the performance of TeacherForcing is inferior to that of the Linear Decay strategy,\nwhich is employed by our approach. We also observe that Linear Decay outperforms AutoRegression. We leverage VideoCLIP to generate alignment features\nbetween videos and scripts.",
        "Conclusion": "Finally, we adopt GRU to conduct multi-step inference. Through comprehensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Finally, we employ GRU for performing multi-step inference. Finally, we obtain the video feature sequence [V1, V2, ..., Vm] and the text feature sequence\n[T1, T2, ..., Tm] of the given function sequence. Ultimately, we obtain the aggregated question-aware video\nfeature V and text feature T .

        "Methodology": "This research explores\nthe concept of sustainable urban transportation with autonomous vehicles, delving\ninto the intricacies of autonomous vehicle technology, urban planning, and environ-\nmental sustainability. Overall, this\nstudy contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable urban transportation,\npresenting a multifaceted analysis of the benefits, challenges, and unforeseen\nconsequences of autonomous vehicle integration, while venturing into uncharted\nterritories, such as the potential for autonomous vehicles to facilitate the creation\nof \"smart\" traffic jams, which can be leveraged to improve overall traffic flow\nand reduce emissions. The investigation unfolds as a complex narrative, weaving\ntogether threads from various disciplines, including computer science, urban plan-\nning, environmental science, and sociology, to create a rich tapestry of knowledge\nand insight into the intricacies of sustainable urban transportation with autonomous\nvehicles. Additionally, the need for standardized regulations and laws governing the use\nof autonomous vehicles raises complex questions about liability, insurance, and public acceptance. In a bizarre twist, some researchers have suggested that the most effective way to implement\nautonomous vehicle technology may be to abandon traditional notions of transportation infrastructure\naltogether, and instead focus on creating \"virtual transportation networks\" that exist solely in the\ndigital realm. According to this unconventional approach, autonomous vehicles would be capable\nof navigating and interacting with virtual environments, rather than physical ones, allowing for the\ncreation of entirely new forms of transportation that are not bound by traditional notions of space\nand distance. Moreover, the integration of autonomous vehicles into urban transportation systems also raises\nimportant questions about the role of human agency and decision-making in the transportation\nprocess. As researchers and policymakers, it is essential that we consider the\nfull range of potential benefits and challenges associated with autonomous vehicle technology, from\nthe environmental and social impacts of their widespread adoption, to the potential for unexpected\nconsequences and unforeseen events. By taking a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach\nto the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology, we can ensure that the\nbenefits of autonomous vehicles are realized, while minimizing the risks and challenges associated\nwith their adoption. Furthermore, the study of autonomous vehicle technology also intersects with other fields, such as\nartificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics, which are essential for the development\nof sophisticated autonomous vehicle systems. As autonomous vehicles become increasingly prevalent, urban planners will need to\nrethink traditional notions of transportation infrastructure, including roads, highways, and public\ntransportation systems. However, the challenges and\ncomplexities associated with autonomous vehicle technology are significant, and will require careful\nconsideration and planning to overcome. By taking a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach\nto the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology, we can ensure that the\nbenefits of autonomous vehicles are realized, while minimizing the risks and challenges associated\nwith their adoption. However,\nthe integration of autonomous vehicles into existing transportation systems is a complex task that\nrequires careful consideration of various factors, including infrastructure, regulations, and public\nacceptance. Since then, there have been\nnumerous advancements in the field, with the development of more sophisticated sensors, algorithms,\nand computing power. This approach is based on the idea that algae can be used to absorb carbon dioxide from the\natmosphere, producing oxygen and organic compounds that can be converted into biofuels. This involves\nusing autonomous vehicles to create a network of interconnected vehicles that can communicate with\neach other and adjust their behavior to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. However, there are also concerns about the safety\nand reliability of autonomous buses, particularly in areas with high levels of pedestrian activity. In addition to the technical and social challenges, there are also regulatory hurdles that need to\nbe addressed. However, the deployment of DSRC technology will require significant investments in\ninfrastructure, including the installation of DSRC transceivers along roads and highways. As researchers and policymakers\ncontinue to explore the use of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation, it is essential\nto consider the many factors that will influence the adoption and deployment of this technology. This approach has the potential to reduce the\nneed for personal vehicle ownership and promote a more shared and sustainable transportation system. This includes technical,\nsocial, and economic factors, as well as regulatory and infrastructure considerations.

In the context of\n3 Methodology\nTo develop a comprehensive framework for sustainable urban transportation with autonomous vehi-\ncles, we employed a multi-faceted approach that integrated theoretical modeling, simulation-based\nanalysis, and empirical data collection. The methodology was divided into distinct phases, each de-\nsigned to investigate a specific aspect of the problem. Initially, we conducted an exhaustive review of\nexisting literature on urban transportation systems, autonomous vehicle technology, and sustainability\nmetrics. This review helped identify key factors influencing the efficiency and environmental impact\n5of autonomous vehicle-based transportation systems, including vehicle routing, traffic signal control,\npassenger demand, and energy consumption. A critical component of our methodology involved the development of a novel mathematical model\nthat captured the complex interactions between autonomous vehicles, urban infrastructure, and\npassenger behavior. The model was formulated as a stochastic optimization problem, where the\nobjective function sought to minimize the overall carbon footprint of the transportation system while\nsatisfying passenger demand and safety constraints. To solve this problem, we utilized a combination\nof metaheuristic algorithms and machine learning techniques, which enabled us to explore a vast\nsolution space and identify optimal configurations for autonomous vehicle deployment and routing. In addition to the mathematical modeling, we also conducted a series of simulation experiments to\nevaluate the performance of our proposed framework under various scenarios. These simulations\nwere performed using a custom-built platform that integrated autonomous vehicle simulators, traffic\nmicrosimulators, and environmental impact assessment tools. The simulations allowed us to analyze\nthe effects of different factors, such as autonomous vehicle penetration rates, traffic signal control\nstrategies, and passenger demand patterns, on the overall sustainability of the transportation system. Furthermore, we incorporated a range of unconventional factors into our simulations, including the\nimpact of urban wildlife on autonomous vehicle navigation and the potential for autonomous vehicles\nto be used as mobile urban gardens. One of the most intriguing aspects of our methodology involved the application of chaos theory and\ncomplexity science principles to the analysis of autonomous vehicle-based transportation systems. By\ntreating the system as a complex, nonlinear network, we were able to identify emergent patterns and\nbehaviors that would have been impossible to predict using traditional modeling approaches. The empirical data collection phase of our methodology involved collaborating with several urban\ntransportation agencies and autonomous vehicle manufacturers to gather real-world data on passenger\ndemand, traffic patterns, and vehicle performance. We also\nconducted a series of surveys and focus groups with passengers and transportation stakeholders to\ngather feedback on the potential benefits and drawbacks of autonomous vehicle-based transportation\nsystems. To further enhance the sustainability of autonomous vehicle-based transportation systems, we explored\nthe potential for integrating these systems with other modes of transportation, such as public transit\nand ride-sharing services. This involved developing a range of novel algorithms and protocols\nfor coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles with other vehicles and transportation\ninfrastructure. By\ncombining theoretical modeling, simulation-based analysis, and empirical data collection, we were\nable to develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating the sustainability of autonomous vehicle-\nbased transportation systems and identifying opportunities for improvement. Ultimately, our methodology provides\na foundation for the development of more sustainable, efficient, and resilient urban transportation\n6systems, which can help to mitigate the environmental impacts of urbanization and improve the\nquality of life for urban residents. 4 Experiments\nTo investigate the efficacy of nanosensor-based soil analysis for urban agriculture, a series of exper-\niments were designed to evaluate the performance of these nanosensors in various soil types and\nconditions. These samples were then categorized into five distinct groups based on\ntheir texture, organic matter content, and pH levels. Each soil sample was further subdivided into three smaller portions, which were then subjected to\ndifferent treatments, including the addition of various nutrients, contaminants, and microorganisms. In addition to the nanosensors, a range of traditional soil analysis techniques were also employed,\nincluding spectroscopy, chromatography, and microscopy. These techniques were used to validate\nthe accuracy and reliability of the nanosensor-based soil analysis system. The experiments were\nconducted over a period of six months, during which time the soil samples were regularly monitored\nand analyzed using both the nanosensors and traditional techniques. To test this hypothesis, the soil samples were exposed to a range of\nmusical genres, including classical, jazz, and rock music. The experimental design also included a range of control groups, which were used to evaluate the\npotential impact of various environmental factors on the nanosensor-based soil analysis system. The control groups were designed to mimic real-world\nurban agricultural scenarios, where the soil conditions can be highly variable and unpredictable. To further evaluate the performance of the nanosensor-based soil analysis system, a range of statistical\nmodels were developed and applied to the experimental data. These models included linear regression,\ndecision trees, and neural networks, all of which were used to identify patterns and relationships\nin the data. These techniques were used to create highly detailed and interactive\nmodels of the soil samples, which could be used to visualize and analyze the data in a more\nintuitive and immersive way. The use of these techniques allowed the researchers to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the complex relationships between the soil parameters and the nanosensor-based\nsoil analysis system. In terms of the specific experimental procedures, the soil samples were first prepared and treated as\ndescribed above. The nanosensors were then inserted into each soil portion, and the soil samples\nwere placed in a controlled environment chamber. The musical vibrations were applied to the soil samples using a specialized sound\nsystem, which was designed to resonate with the nanosensors. The experiments were conducted in a\nrandomized and replicated design, with multiple replicates of each treatment and control group. The data were first cleaned and filtered to remove any errors or inconsistencies,\nand then subjected to a range of statistical analyses, including hypothesis testing and regression\nanalysis. classical) resulting in higher accuracy and\nreliability. Initially,\nthe nanosensors were calibrated to detect minute variations in soil composition, including pH levels,\nnutrient content, and moisture saturation. The calibration process involved immersing the nanosensors\nin a controlled soil environment with predetermined characteristics, allowing for the establishment of\na baseline for subsequent measurements. To further explore the efficacy of soil sonification, a series of experiments were conducted, involving\nthe exposure of crops to various sound wave frequencies and amplitudes. 8In an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving these phenomena, a team of\nresearchers was assembled to conduct a thorough analysis of the nanosensor data and soil sonification\nexperiments. However, the development of such systems will\nrequire a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating expertise from fields such as materials science,\nagronomy, and environmental engineering. The journey ahead will be\nlong and challenging, but the potential rewards are well worth the effort, and the possibilities for\ninnovation and discovery are endless. As we embark on this exciting journey, we must remain open\nto new ideas, perspectives, and approaches, embracing the complexity and uncertainty of the research\nendeavor, and striving to create a brighter, more sustainable future for all. However, it is also crucial to consider the potential risks and challenges associated\n9with the widespread adoption of this technology, including the possibility of nanosensor malfunction,\nsoil contamination, and the impact on local ecosystems. Furthermore, the integration of nanosensor-\nbased soil analysis with other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of\nThings, could lead to the creation of highly sophisticated and autonomous urban farming systems. By embracing\nthis unpredictability, and using nanosensors to monitor and analyze the complex interactions within\nsoil ecosystems, farmers and researchers could develop a more nuanced and dynamic understanding\nof soil behavior, and could potentially uncover new and innovative approaches to soil management\nand optimization. By taking a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach\nto the development and implementation of nanosensor-based soil analysis, we can unlock the full\npotential of this technology, and create a more sustainable, productive, and resilient food system for\ngenerations to come. By embracing a holistic and integrated approach to soil analysis, and by considering the\ncomplex interactions between soil, plants, and the environment, we can create a more sustainable,\nequitable, and food-secure future for all. As we move forward in this exciting and rapidly evolving field, it will be\nimportant to remain open-minded, curious, and receptive to new ideas and perspectives, and to be\nwilling to challenge our assumptions and push the boundaries of what is thought to be possible. This approach could also be used to develop novel soil\namendments and fertilizers, which are tailored to the specific needs of individual crops and soil\ntypes.

        "Abstract": "Harnessing Astronomical Data for Automated Creative\nText Generation: An LSTM-Based Model for\nSpace-Infused Language Tasks\nAbstract\nThis study delves into the uncharted territory of harnessing Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) distortions as a catalyst for automated poetry generation,\nleveraging the capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to craft\nspace-inspired verse.",
        "Methodology": "One of the more intriguing aspects of this approach is the potential for the LSTM network to\n\"discover\" new forms of poetic expression, unencumbered by traditional notions of verse and meter. 23 Methodology\nTo investigate the potential of cosmic microwave background distortions in generating space-inspired\npoetry, we employed a long short-term memory (LSTM) approach, leveraging the intricate patterns\nfound within the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Our methodology began with the collection of CMB data from various spacecraft, including the\nCosmic Background Explorer (COBE) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We then applied a series of complex algorithms to translate the CMB data into a musical composition,\nutilizing a bespoke software package that mapped temperature fluctuations in the CMB to musical\nnotes. To further refine our approach, we developed an LSTM model that could learn the patterns and\nstructures of the CMB-Inspired Free Verse poems and generate new poems based on these patterns. The LSTM model was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 poems, each inspired by the \"Cosmic\nCacophony\" melody. Overall, our methodology has demonstrated the potential of using CMB distortions to generate\nspace-inspired poetry through a combination of musical composition, sonic entrainment, and LSTM\nmodeling. Our approach involved preprocessing CMB data from various sources, including the Planck satellite\nand the South Pole Telescope, to create a unique dataset that encoded thermal and kinetic distortions. This dataset was then used to train an LSTM model, with parameters tuned to optimize poetic\noutput based on metrics such as rhythm, meter, and semantic coherence. An unexpected twist in\nour methodology was the introduction of a \"galactic noise\" component, which we hypothesized\ncould enhance the creative potential of the model by simulating the effects of cosmic radiation on\n3digital systems. Further analysis revealed that these poems, when fed back into the model as input, could\ninduce a self-referential loop, causing the LSTM to generate verse after verse of what appeared to\nbe pure, unadulterated nonsense, yet somehow still maintaining a haunting, almost otherworldly\naesthetic appeal. To further explore this hypothesis, we conducted a series of\nexperiments in which the LSTM model was exposed to various forms of avant-garde music, including\nthe works of Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage.",
        "Results and Findings": "Intriguingly, our preliminary results suggest\nthat poems crafted under the influence of CMB distortions exhibit a peculiar\npropensity for referencing 19th-century French culinary practices, despite the\ncomplete absence of any gastronomically related input data. Recent studies have shown that the distortions present in the cosmic microwave background can be\nused to generate musical compositions, with the varying frequencies and amplitudes of the radiation\ntranslating into a unique soundscape. For example, a poem\ngenerated by the network was found to contain references to a previously unknown galaxy, which was\nsubsequently confirmed by astronomers. While this result is undoubtedly anomalous and in need of\nfurther verification, it highlights the potential for this approach to not only generate innovative poetry,\nbut also contribute to our understanding of the universe itself. While the\nresults of these experiments have been met with a degree of skepticism by some members of the\nacademic community, they nonetheless represent a fascinating example of the innovative and often\nunorthodox thinking that characterizes this field of research. These\nefforts have yielded a range of impressive results, from the creation of vivid, cosmically-inspired\nlandscapes to the generation of poignant, philosophically-charged reflections on the human condition. Regardless of the underlying\nexplanation, the results of these experiments have been nothing short of astonishing, yielding poetry\nthat is at once deeply personal and profoundly cosmic in its scope and ambition. In a surprising twist, we discovered that the \"Cosmic Cacophony\" melody could be used to generate\npoetic verse through a process of \"sonic entrainment.\" This finding has significant\nimplications for the field of cosmology and suggests that the intersection of poetry and physics may\nbe more intimate than previously thought. The results of our research have significant implications for the fields of cosmology, poetry,\nand artificial intelligence, and suggest that the intersection of these fields may be more fruitful than\npreviously thought. The results of our initial training runs were intriguing, with the LSTM model producing poems that\nnot only reflected the thermal fluctuations of the CMB but also seemed to capture the existential and\nphilosophical undertones of cosmological inquiry. To quantify these findings, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the model\u2019s performance\nacross various poetic parameters, as outlined in the following table: These results suggest that while\nTable 1: Performance Metrics for CMB-Inspired Poetry Generation\nDistortion Type Galactic Noise Level Poetic Coherence Cosmic Relevance\nGravitational Lensing Low 0.82 0.71\nThermal Medium 0.65 0.85\nSunyaev-Zeldovich High 0.42 0.92\nthe introduction of galactic noise does compromise the model\u2019s ability to produce coherent poetry, it\nsignificantly enhances the cosmic relevance of the generated verse, leading to the creation of a unique,\nspace-inspired poetic genre that challenges traditional notions of aesthetic value and cosmological\ninquiry. 5 Results\nOur investigation into the utilization of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distortions for the\ngeneration of space-inspired poetry via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks yielded a\nplethora of intriguing results. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that the LSTM model\u2019s performance was substantially enhanced\nwhen fed a diet of esoteric texts, including the works of mystic poets and ancient cosmological\ntreatises. This unexpected finding prompted us to hypothesize that the model was, in fact, tapping into\na hidden reservoir of cosmic knowledge, whereby the esoteric texts served as a catalyst for unlocking\nthe poetic potential of the CMB data. The results of these experiments were nothing\nshort of astonishing, as the model proceeded to generate poems that not only captured the essence of\nthe music but also appeared to predict the occurrence of certain cosmological events, such as solar\nflares and gamma-ray bursts. In an effort to quantify the efficacy of our approach, we compiled a comprehensive dataset of space-\ninspired poems, which we then subjected to a rigorous analysis using a combination of natural\nlanguage processing techniques and cosmological metrics. The results of this analysis are presented\nin the following table: As can be seen from the table, the poetic metrics and cosmological correlations\nexhibit a high degree of interdependence, suggesting that the LSTM model is, indeed, capable of\ncapturing the underlying essence of the CMB and channeling it into the realm of poetic expression. Interestingly, our experiments have also uncovered a peculiar correlation between the fluctuations in\nthe CMB data and the emergence of poetic themes related to existentialism and the human condition. By analyzing the poetic output of the\nLSTM in response to various CMB distortion patterns, we have discovered that certain combinations\nof cosmic data can yield verses that are remarkably similar to astrological readings, complete with\nreferences to celestial bodies and mystical themes.",
        "Conclusion": "6 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, our investigation into the utilization of Cosmic Microwave Background distortions for\nthe purpose of automated poetry generation has yielded a multitude of intriguing results, challenging\nour initial hypotheses and inviting further exploration. Ultimately, our study has demonstrated the viability of leveraging CMB distortions for the purpose\nof automated poetry generation, while also highlighting the vast, uncharted territories that lie at the\nintersection of cosmology, artificial intelligence, and creative expression. 5"

        "Abstract": "OmniPrint: A Configurable Generator for Printed\nCharacters\nAbstract\nWe introduce OmniPrint, a synthetic data generator for isolated printed characters\ndesigned to support machine learning research.",
        "Methodology": "While being inspired by popular\ndatasets, such as MNIST, SVHN, and Omniglot, OmniPrint provides the unique\nability to produce a wide range of printed characters from various languages, fonts,\nand styles, with custom distortions. Since collecting and labeling data can be time-consuming and expensive,\nartificial data generation can be used to drive ML research. Additionally, data are often affected by\nnuisance variables z, which are discrete or continuous labels that represent metadata or covariates. For our work, zmay include character distortions such as shear, rotation, line width variations, or\nbackground changes. We expect that progress made using\nOmniPrint to benchmark machine learning systems should foster progress in these domains. The synthesizer must support pre-rasterization manipulation of anchor points, post-rasterization\ndistortions, seamless background blending, foreground filling, anti-aliasing rendering, and be easily\nextensible with new fonts and styles. The software is designed to allow researchers to generate data in a form that makes\nit easier to train machine learning models. To obtain a large number of classes (Y labels), we\nmanually selected and filtered characters from the Unicode standard, forming alphabets for over 20\nlanguages. We added a feature using the FreeType rasterization engine which enables\nvector-based pre-rasterization transformations. Additionally, we enriched background generation\nwith seamless blending, and enabled custom post-rasterization transformations. We also implemented\nutility code including dataset formatters, and a data loader which generates episodes for meta-learning\napplications. \u2022Pre-rasterization transformed character: FreeType performs all the pre-rasterization\n(vector-based) transformations. Pre-rasterization manipulations include linear transforms,\nstroke width variation, random elastic transformation, and variation of character proportion. The RGB bitmaps output by FreeType are called the foreground layer. \u2022Pixel character on white background: Post-rasterization transformations are applied to\nthe foreground layer. The layer is kept at a high resolution, using ReLU activations, to avoid\nartifacts. The RGB image is then resized using a three step process; applying a Gaussian\nfilter to smooth the image, reducing the image by an integer factor, and resizing using\nLanczos resampling. \u2022Pixel character on textured background: The foreground is then pasted onto the back-\nground. \u2022Logging and Visualization: The library utilizes a Weights Biases tool to log the training\nprocess and the visualizations.

        "Results and Findings": "However, our exploration\nof available resources revealed that there is no synthesizer that fulfills all of our needs. The fonts are selected by an automatic\nfont collection module. To our knowledge, OmniPrint is the first text image synthesizer geared toward ML\nresearch to support pre-rasterization transforms.

        "Abstract": "Usefulness of LLMs as an Author Checklist Assistant\nfor Scientific Papers: Experiment\nAbstract\nLarge language models (LLMs) represent a promising, but controversial, tool in\naiding scientific peer review. One promising application of LLMs\nis in aiding the scientific peer-review process. The Paper Checklist is a series of yes/no questions that help authors check if their\nwork meets reproducibility, transparency, and ethical research standards expected for papers. Claims: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper2019s\ncontri- butions and scope? Safeguards: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of\ndata or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators,\nor scraped datasets)? Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Sub- jects:\nDoes the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were\ndisclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent\napproval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? The experiment consisted of creating 10 pairs of abstracts, where one abstract in each pair was\nmade 2018 clearly 2019 and objectively stronger than the other. To simulate diverse, yet irrelevant\nconditions, the language of the abstracts was deliberately varied. In this test, GPT-4 performed no\nbetter than random chance in identifying the stronger abstract, underscoring that while LLMs may\nexcel at some complex tasks like scientific error identification, they often struggle with seemingly\nsimpler tasks. Participation was fully voluntary, and participants were recruited through a blog post that was released\n8 days before the abstract submission deadline. Note that it is not possible to tell from\nthe responses how many inaccuracies participants found in individual questions since the survey did\nnot ask about individual checklist questions. 4.2 Changes to Submissions in Response to Feedback\nIn the following analysis, we integrate an assessment of the LLM 2019s feedback with the authors\n2019 checklist answers, to better understand whether the Checklist Assistant helped authors make\nconcrete and meaningful changes to their papers. For example, on\nthe 201cClaims 201d question, the LLM commented on consistency and precision in documenting\nclaims on 50 papers, including feedback like matching the abstract and introduction and referencing\nappendices. 2 or fewer authors mentioned improving the intro/abstract, discussion of limitations, and discussion\nof standard errors.",
        "Methodology": "We conduct an experiment where 234 papers were voluntarily submitted to an\n201cLLM- based Checklist Assistant.201d This assistant validates whether papers\nadhere to the author checklist, which includes questions to ensure compliance with\nresearch and manuscript preparation standards. Evaluation of the assistant by paper\nauthors suggests that the LLM-based assistant was generally helpful in verifying\nchecklist completion. LLMs can hallucinate, exhibit biases, and may\ncompromise the fairness of the peer-review process. Despite these potential issues, LLMs may serve\nas useful analytical tools to scrutinize manuscripts and identify possible weaknesses or inaccuracies\nthat need addressing. In this study, we take the first steps towards harnessing the power of LLMs in the application of\nconference peer review. Specifically, the peer-review process requires authors to submit a checklist appended to their\nmanuscripts. Such author checklists, utilized in as well as in other peer-review venues, contain\na set of questions designed to ensure that authors follow appropriate research and manuscript prepa-\nration practices. The\nchecklist is a critical component in maintaining standards of research presented at the conference. Adhering to the guidelines outlined by these checklists helps authors avoid mistakes that could lead\nto rejection during peer review. This assistant scrutinizes au-\nthors2019 responses to the checklist, proposing enhancements for submissions to meet the confer-\nence2019s requirements. To prevent any potential bias in the review process, we confine its usage\nexclusively to the authors of papers, so the checklist assistant is not accessible to reviewers. We then\nsystematically evaluate the benefits and risks of LLMs by conducting a structured study to understand\nif LLMs can enhance research quality and improve efficiency by helping authors understand if their\nwork meets research standards. Specifically, we administered surveys both before and after use of\nthe Checklist Assistant asking authors about their expectations for and perceptions of the tool. After using the assistant, over 70\n\u2022Authors 2019 expectations of the assistant 2019s effectiveness were even more positive\nbefore using it than their assessments after actually using it (Section 4.1.3). \u2022Among the main issues reported by authors in qualitative feedback, the most frequently cited\nwere inaccuracy (20/52 respondents) and that the LLM was too strict in its requirements\n(14/52 respon- dents) (Section 4.1.4). \u2022In 40 instances, authors submitted their paper twice to the checklist verifier (accounting for\n80 total paper submissions.) Between these two submissions, authors tended to increase the\nlength of their checklist justifications significantly, suggesting that they may have added\ncontent in response to LLM feedback (Section 4.2.3). In summary, the majority of authors found LLM assistance to be beneficial, highlighting the significant\npotential of LLMs to enhance scientific workflows 2014 whether by serving as direct assistants to\nauthors or helping journals and conferences verify guideline compliance. A notable portion of\nusers encountered inaccuracies, and the models were also vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. These questions are designed\nby organizers, not specifically for this study, and questions are carried over from previous years. The authors had to provide a response to each question, comprising 201cYes,201d 2018No201d or\n201cNA201d (Not Applicable), along with a justification for their answer. Limitations: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects: For crowdsourcing experiments and research\nwith human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and\nscreen- shots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Here, a language model first computes\na 201csimilarity score 201d between every reviewer-paper pair, based on the text of the submitted\npaper and the text of the reviewer2019s previously published papers. Given these similarity scores, reviewers are then assigned to papers using an optimization\nroutine that maximizes the similarity scores of the assigned reviewer-paper pairs. There have been recent works that design or use LLMs to write the entire review of papers. It is not entirely clear how these ratings translate to\nmeeting the objectives of peer review in practice namely that of identifying errors, choosing better\npapers, and providing useful feedback to authors. Moreover, it is also known that evaluation of\npeer reviews themselves are fraught with biases, and the aggregate effect of such biases on these\nevaluations of reviews is not clear. Our work focuses on a more concrete task in reviewing papers\nthan generating an end-to-end review, namely validating that papers meet criteria specified in an\n3Author Checklist. Moreover, we evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in the setting of an actual peer review\nconference. The paper constructs a set of short papers with deliberately inserted errors and asks\nLLMs to identify errors. GPT-4 does identify the error more than half the time. Note that in both experiments, the prompts specifically asked the LLM to\nfind errors rather than generically asking the LLM to review the paper. Moreover, both experiments\nhad small sample sizes in terms of the number of papers. The papers investigate the performance of LLMs in evaluating checklist compliance. These studies,\nhowever, were retrospective studies of published papers, whereas our work is deployed live associated\nto a peer-review venue and helps authors improve their checklist compliance before they make their\nsubmission. Recent work has highlighted the prevalence of the use of LLMs both in preparation of scientific paper\nmanuscripts and in the generation of scientific peer reviews. For example, estimates that as of January\n2024, 17.5\n3 Methodology\nWe design an LLM-based tool (Checklist Assistant) to assist authors in ensuring their submitted\nchecklists are thoroughly answered. Our platform interfaced with a third-party LLM (GPT-4 from\nOpenAI), using simple prompt engineering with these hyper-parameters: temperature = 1, topp = 1,\nand n = 1. For each checklist question, the LLM is provided with the author2019s checklist response\nand justification, alongside the complete paper and any appendices. The LLM2019s role is to assess\nthe accuracy and thoroughness of each response and justification, offering targeted suggestions for\nimprovement. Each checklist item is treated as an individual task, i.e., an API call with only one\nquestion, its answer and justification by the author, and the paper and appendices. Authors are encouraged to\ncarefully review any orange feedback, validate the identified issues, and make the necessary revisions\nto align with the checklist requirements. We configured 15 Google Cloud CPU\nworkers, integrated with Codabench, to handle multiple paper submissions concurrently. The bulk of\nthe computations were carried out by the LLM third-party software (GPT-4 from OpenAI) via API\ncalls (one call per question, and additional calls in case of failure). Interested participants were asked to register though\na Google form. Participants who submitted registration requests through the Google form were then\ngiven access to the Assistant on the Codabench platform. The submissions were entirely optional and\ncompletely separate from the paper submission system and the review process. The papers had to be\nformatted as specified in the call for papers (complete with appendices and checklist). Information\nprovided in external links was not taken into account by the assistant. We asked submitters to fill out\n4the checklist to the best of their abilities. Submissions made via the Codabench landing page were\nprocessed as follows:\nChecklist Assistant: The paper was parsed using a PDF-to-text parser, then screened for any problems\nsuch as the format of the paper or checklist, etc. Each answered question in the checklist was\nprocessed by an LLM using an API. We encountered several parsing issues with both paper texts and checklists. Special characters, especially merged letters like 201cfi 201d and 201cfl 201d in\nthe submitted PDFs required further parsing updates. Tuning was\ncarried out using a dozen papers. Some checklists were filled out with our best effort to be correct,\nand others included deliberately planted errors to verify robustness and calibrate the scores. We\nobserved that the LLM performed better with clear, step-by-step instructions. Our final prompt provided a sequence of instructions covering different aspects of the required\nreview, designed as follows: first, the context is set by indicating that the paper is under review for\nthe conference. Next, the main goal is clarified, specifying that the LLM2019s primary task is to\nassist the author in responding to the checklist question. The LLM is then directed to review the\nauthor2019s answer and justification, identifying any discrepancies with the paper based on the\nspecific guidelines of the question. It is instructed to provide itemized, actionable feedback according\nto the guidelines, offering suggestions for improvement, with clear examples for responses such as\n201cYes, 201d 201cNo, 201d or 201cNA. Before prompt adjustments, LLM responses often mixed the review with the score. For long papers\nexceeding 35 pages (or 15,000 words), we processed only the first 15,000 words and notified authors\nwith a warning. 201d\nAlthough the Checklist Assistant returned scores of 0, 0.5, and 1, we combined the 0 and 0.5 scores\nto indicate that improvement was needed, rather than differentiating between two levels of severity\n(with red for 0 and orange for 0.5). This decision was made due to concerns that the LLM 2019s\nevaluations might be too harsh. We also tested whether the LLM was consistent in generating answers for reiterations of the same\ninput. As a sanity check, we test for each question, whether the variation of the output scores for\nmultiple runs on the same paper is comparable to the variation across papers. We find that the\nvariation in scores for multiple runs on the same paper is significantly lower than variation across\npapers (p < 0.05; based on a one sided permutation test after BH correction) for all but one question. The papers and LLM outputs were\nkept confidential and were not be accessible to reviewers, meta reviewers, and program chairs. It is\nimportant to note that while authors retained ownership of their submissions, the papers were sent to\nthe API of an LLM service, and treated under their conditions of confidentiality. This study was approved by the Carnegie Mellon University Institutional Review Board (IRB). The\nparticipants gave written documentation of informed consent to participate. 4 Experiments\nIn our evaluations, we seek to address two main questions regarding the use of an LLM-automated\nAuthor Checklist Assistant:\n(1) Do authors perceive an LLM Author Checklist Assistant as a valuable enhancement to the paper\nsub- mission process? In order to understand author experience using the provided Author Checklist Assistant, we surveyed\nauthors before and after submitting to the Author Checklist Assistant. Additionally, we analyzed the\ncontent and submission patterns of author 2019s checklists and the LLM responses. 4.1 Author Perception and Experience\nFirst, we analyze the authors 2019 usage patterns and perceptions of the Author Checklist Assistant,\nas captured through surveys. In Section 4.1.1, we provide an overview of how authors filled out the\nchecklist and the responses given by the LLM on their checklists. As illustrated in Figure\n2a, most questions received a Yes response, indicating that the authors confirmed their paper met\nthe corresponding checklist criteria. In response to the authors 2019 checklists, the LLM provided written feedback, with green indicating\n2018No Concerns 2019 and orange indicating 2018Needs improvement 2019. Figure 2b illustrates\nthe distribution of LLM feedback for each checklist question. For most questions, the majority of\nfeedback suggested that the checklist or manuscript could be improved. 2019 This likely reflects the LLM 2019s confidence in\nconfirming that certain papers did not include theory, human subjects research, or clear broader risks,\nmaking those checklist items irrelevant. In Figure 3, we show the distribution of LLM evaluations\nper submission. All submissions received several 2018Needs improvement 2019 ratings, with each\nbeing advised to improve on 8 to 13 out of the 15 checklist questions. 64.1.2 Survey Methodology\nTo assess authors 2019 perceptions of the usefulness of the Author Checklist Assistant, we conducted\na survey with all participants both at registration (pre-usage) and immediately after using the Author\nChecklist Assistant (post-usage). Both surveys\ncontained the same four questions, with the pre-usage survey focusing on expectations and the post-\nusage survey on actual experience. Responses were recorded on a four-point Likert scale, ranging\nfrom strongly disagree to strongly agree. In the post-usage survey, we also asked authors to provide\nfreeform feedback on (1) any changes they planned to make to their paper, and (2) any issues they\nencountered while using the Checklist Assistant. However, we received\nonly 78 responses to the post-usage survey, representing 63 unique participants (due to multiple\nsubmissions for the same paper). While completing the pre-registration survey was mandatory for all\nparticipants, the post-usage survey was optional. As a result, all participants in the post-usage survey\nhad also completed the pre-registration survey. In cases where authors\nsubmitted the survey multiple times for the same paper, we included only the earliest post-usage\nresponse. 70\nIt is notable that authors were even more positive before using the tool. This may reflect that the number of 2018needs improvement 2019 scores was less important in author\n2019s perception than the written content of the LLM 2019s evaluation. Finally, we examined potential selection bias due to the drop-off in participation in the post-usage\nsurvey by analyzing the pre-usage survey responses across different groups. As noted earlier, only\na portion of the 539 participants who completed the pre-usage survey went on to submit papers\n(234 Submitters), and an even smaller group responded to the post-usage survey (78 Post-Usage\nRespondents). In Figure 7, we compare the pre-usage survey responses between Submitters and\nNon-Submitters, as well as between Post- Usage Respondents and Non-Respondents. 4.1.4 Challenges in Usage\nIn addition to the structured survey responses, 52 out of the 78 post-usage survey submissions\nincluded freeform feedback detailing issues with the Checklist Assistant 2019s usage. We manually\ncategorized the reported issues from these responses and identified the following primary concerns,\nlisted in order of decreasing frequency (summarized in Figure 8):\nInaccurate: 20 authors reported that the LLM was inaccurate. Many participants noted specific issues, in particular\nthat the LLM overlooked content in the paper, requesting changes to either the checklist or the paper\n7for elements that the authors believed were already addressed. Additionally, some authors reported\nmore nuanced accuracy issues. For instance, one author mentioned that the LLM misinterpreted a\n201cthought experiment 201d as a real experiment and incorrectly asked for more details about the\nexperimental setup. Another author reported that the LLM mistakenly assumed human subjects were\ninvolved due to a discussion of 201cinterpretability 201d in the paper. Too generic: 4 authors reported that the feedback they received was not specific enough to their paper. Insufficient LLM capabilities: 4 authors complained that the LLM could not handle content over the\n(LLM assistant 2019s) page limit or that it was not multimodal and hence ignored figures. Feedback inconsistent across submissions: 3 authors reported that the LLM feedback changed across\nmultiple submissions to the server even though the paper and checklist content did not change. Desire for full paper review: 3 authors reported that they would like feedback on the entire paper, not\njust on checklist items. Bad at theory (mathematical) papers: 2 authors wrote that the LLM seemed bad at theory (mathemati-\ncal) papers. Too verbose: 2 authors wrote that the LLM 2019s feedback was too wordy. In Section 4.2.1, we analyze the types of feedback\ngiven by the LLM to authors. In Section 4.2.2, we overview the changes to their papers that authors\nself-reported making in survey responses. 4.2.1 Characterization of LLM Feedback by Question\nFor authors to make meaningful changes to their papers, the Author Checklist Assistant must provide\nconcrete feedback. In this section, we analyze the type of feedback given by the Checklist Assistant\nto determine whether it is specific to the checklist answers or more generic. Given the large volume of feedback, we employed an LLM to extract key points from the Checklist\nAssistant 2019s responses for each question on the paper checklist and to cluster these points into\noverarching categories. Specifically, for each of the 15 questions across the 234 checklist submissions,\nwe used GPT-4 to identify the main points of feedback provided to authors. We manually inspected\nthat the main points extracted by GPT-4 matched the long-form feedback on 10 randomly selected\nsubmitted paper checklists and found that GPT-4 was highly accurate in extracting these key feedback\npoints. Here are our\nkey observations from this analysis. The LLM identified many granular types of feedback within each checklist question. For instance, the LLM gave granular feedback\nwithin the Experimental settings/details question on optimizer configuration details, implementation\ncode availability, and explicit mention of non-traditional experiments. The LLM tended to provide 4-6 distinct points of feedback per question (for each of the 15 questions). The LLM is capable of giving concrete and specific feedback for many questions. On the 201cCompute resources 201d question the LLM commented specifically on\ndetailing compute / execution time of methods. 8The LLM tends to provide some generic boilerplate for each question. The most common category of\nfeedback for each question is a generic commentary on enhancing general aspects of the question. Such a detailed checklist could be\nprocessed automatically by an LLM to systematically identify specific, commonly overlooked issues\nin scientific papers and flag concrete issues for authors to resolve. 4.2.2 Authors2019 Descriptions of Submission Changes\nWe obtain additional evidence of changes made by authors in response to the Checklist Assistant\nthrough the post-usage survey. Of the 78\nsurvey responses, 45 provided feedback to this question. Of these 45 responses, 35 actually described\nchanges they would make (the remainder used this freeform feedback to describe issues that they had\nin using the assistant). 2 authors said they would change an answer to the checklist that they filled out incorrectly. Overall, these responses indicate that some authors were motivated to modify their submissions due\nto feedback from the checklist verification. There were 40 instances where an author submitted the same paper to\nthe checklist verification multiple times (out of 184 total distinct paper submissions to the checklist\nverification). In this analysis, we assess changes made to the paper checklist between the first and\nsecond submission to our checklist verifier in order to understand whether authors made substantive\nchanges to their checklists and/or paper manuscripts in response to feedback from the checklist\nverification.",
        "Results and Findings": "This study evaluates the usefulness of LLMs in a con-\nference setting as a tool for vetting paper submissions against submission standards. We conduct an experiment at a premier conference in the field of machine\nlearning. While the wider ethical implications and appropriate use cases of LLMs remain unclear and\nmust be a larger community discussion, here, we evaluate a relatively clear-cut and low-risk use case:\nvetting paper submissions against submission standards, with results shown only to the authors. We\n.received 539 responses to the pre-usage survey, 234 submissions the the Checklist Assistant and 78\nresponses to the post-usage survey. Our main findings are as follows:\n(1) Authors generally reported that the LLM-assisted checklist review was a valuable enhancement to\nthe paper submission process. \u2022The majority of surveyed authors reported a positive experience using the LLM assistant. (2) While changes in paper submissions cannot be causally attributed to use of the checklist verifi-\ncation assistant, we find qualitative evidence that the checklist review meaningfully helped some\nauthors to improve their submissions. \u2022Analysis of the content of LLM feedback to authors indicates that the LLM provided\ngranular feedback to authors, generally giving 4-6 distinct and specific points of feedback\nper question across the 15 questions (Section 4.2.1). \u2022Survey responses reflect that some authors made meaningful changes to their submissions\n201435 survey respondents described specific modifications they would make to their\nsubmissions in response to the Checklist Assistant (Section 4.2.2). However, our findings also\nunderscore that LLMs cannot fully replace human expertise in these contexts. Experimental Result Reproducibility: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to\nreproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims\nand/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Open access to data and code: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient\ninstructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental\nmaterial? necessary to understand the results? Licenses for existing assets: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models),\nused in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and\nproperly respected? 2.2 Related work\nLanguage models have been used in the scientific peer review process for over a decade. Recent work also investigates whether LLMs can identify errors in papers and shows promising\ninitial results. It successfully and\nconsis- tently does so on one paper, partially and occasionally on a second paper, and is consistently\nunsuccessful on the third. The API call\nreturns a review and score for the submitted question. In these examples, green indicates that the tool found 201cno significant concerns201d, while orange\nsignals 201cneeds improvement201d with the Paper Checklist standards. Result Compilation: LLM responses were combined for all questions and formatted in an HTML\ndocument with proper colors and structure for readability and user-friendliness. Initially, our parser\nstruggled with subsections and titles, prompting code improvements to handle sections accurately. We hypothesized that users might find the LLM responses overly strict, vague, and lengthy (which\nwas indeed later confirmed), so we added prompt instructions like 201cuse 0 score sparingly 201d,\n201cprovide itemized, actionable feedback 201d, and 201cfocus on significant improvements. 53.3 Anonymity, confidentiality, and consent\nThe authors could retain their anonymity by registering to Codabench with an email that did not\nreveal their identity, and by submitting anonymized papers. A summary of our\nmain findings is given in Section 1. In Section 4.1, we give results on author perception\nand experience and in Section 4.2 we analyze changes made by authors to their submissions after\nusing the Author Checklist Assistant. In Section 4.1.2, we detail the\nsurvey methodology used to understand author experience and in Section 4.1.3, we analyze results of\nthe survey. We provide the content of the surveys in Figure 4. We received 539 responses to the pre-usage survey and 234 papers submitted. We include responses from authors who completed both surveys (n=63). Including the duplicated responses made a negligible difference, with the proportion of\npositive responses changing by less than 0.02 across all questions. Comparing pre- and post-\nusage responses, there was a statistically significant drop in positive feedback on the 201cUseful 201d\nand 201cExcited to Use 201d questions 2014we run a permutation test with 50,0000 permutations to\ntest whether the difference between proportion of positive responses pre and post-usage is non-zero,\nwhich gives Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values of 0.007 and 0.013 for 201cExcited to Use 201d\nand 201cUseful 201d respectively with effect sizes of 22120.23 and 22120.2. We also assessed the correlation between post-usage survey responses and the number of 2018needs\nimprove- ment 2019 scores given by the LLM to authors. In Figure 6, we show mean number of\nneeds improvement scores for authors responding positively or negatively to each survey question. We find no substantial ef- fect of number of 2018needs improvement 2019 scores on survey responses. No substantial\ndifferences in rates of positive responses were found (using a permutation test for the difference in\nmean response, gave p-values of > 0.3 for all questions before multiple testing correction), suggesting\nthere is no significant selection bias. Infeasible to make changes due to page limits: 5 authors felt that they received useful feedback, but it\nwould not be possible to incorporate due to their papers already being at the page limit. We then passed the names and descriptions of these feedback points to GPT-4 to hierarchically\ncluster them into broader themes. The LLM often expands the scope of checklist questions. We provide a full list of the summarized main themes of feedback in Appendix C. In summary, our\nanalysis of the feedback given by the LLM suggests that the LLM gave concrete and actionable\nfeedback to authors that they could potentially use to modify their paper submissions. Our analysis\nalso suggests that a more detailed checklist could be developed to provide more granular feedback,\nbased on the rubrics covered by the Author Checklist Assistant. In the survey, we asked authors to detail in freeform feedback any\nchanges they had made or planned to make in responses to feedback from the LLM. Based on manual coding of the comments, we identified the main themes in\nchanges they planned to make:\n14 authors said that they would improve justifications for their checklist answers by including more\ndetail and/or references to paper sections. 6 authors said that they would add more details about experiments, datasets, or compute. 9",
        "Conclusion": "Finally, we investigate how LLM-based tools can be easily manipulated 2013 specifically, we find\nthat with AI- assisted re-writing of the justifications, an adversarial author can make the Checklist\nAssistant significantly more lenient (Section 5.1). The\noutcome measures for evaluating the effectiveness of the LLM- generated reviews are based on\nratings sourced from authors or other researchers. 201d At the end of the review, the LLM is asked to assign\na score: Score=1 for no issues, Score=0.5 for minor improvements, and Score=0 for critical issues. Finally, the LLM is provided with the checklist question, the author 2019s answer, justification, the\nrelevant guidelines, and the paper content. To fix this, we\nspecified that the score should be returned on a separate line at the end of the review. Finally, in Section 4.1.4, we overview the main challenges identified by authors when\nusing the Author Checklist Assistant. Too strict: 14 authors reported that the LLM was too strict. Lastly, in Section 4.2.3, we analyze changes made in\nmultiple submissions of the same paper to the Author Checklist Assistant. 4.2.3 Analysis of Re-submissions\nFinally, we analyze changes made between submissions to the Checklist Assistant when authors\nsubmitted multiple times."

        "Abstract": "Applying Swarm Intelligence to Real-Time Stage\nLighting: A Framework for Dynamic Audience\nEngagement\nAbstract\nThis paper delves into the uncharted territory of entomological hyperreality, where\nthe collective behavior of insect swarms is harnessed to create an immersive the-\natrical experience, transcending the boundaries of conventional stage lighting and\nemotional crowd control.",
        "Methodology": "Theoretically, this synergy is expected to induce a state of\nemotional hyperarousal, wherein the crowd\u2019s collective emotional resonance is\namplified and manipulated through the strategic deployment of swarm-inspired\nlighting patterns. Ultimately, our research aims to push the boundaries of\nhuman-insect interaction, challenging traditional notions of performance, spectacle,\nand the human experience, while navigating the uncharted territories of swarm\nintelligence, chaos theory, and the intricacies of the human emotional psyche. To address this challenge, researchers have been exploring the use of machine learning techniques,\nsuch as neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, to generate swarm-inspired lighting patterns\nthat can be adapted to different performance contexts. In an unexpected twist, some researchers have been exploring the use of swarm intelligence in\ntheatrical stage lighting as a means of inducing a state of collective hysteria in the audience, where\nthe use of complex lighting patterns and movements can be used to create a sense of shared frenzy\nand excitement. This approach has been inspired\nby the work of Carl Jung, who believed that the collective unconscious was a shared reservoir of\narchetypes and emotions that are common to all humans, and that it could be accessed through the\nuse of certain visual and symbolic stimuli. By analyzing the vibrational frequencies\nproduced by certain species of beetles, researchers have developed novel sound synthesis techniques,\ncapable of generating a wide range of tonal colors and textures. Furthermore, investigations into the realm of swarm intelligence have led to the development of novel\nmethods for crowd control and emotional manipulation. This has led to the creation of sophisticated systems for predicting and\nmitigating crowd disturbances, as well as techniques for inducing specific emotional states in large\ngroups of people. By\ncreating intricate and recursive patterns, reminiscent of the natural world, researchers have been able\nto induce states of deep relaxation, increased focus, and heightened creativity in audiences. This has\nled to the development of novel therapeutic techniques, wherein patients are exposed to fractal-based\nlighting environments, designed to promote emotional healing and balance. Are these systems truly creative, or are they simply executing a set of pre-programmed\ninstructions? Can we consider the swarm itself as a form of collective artist, working in tandem with\nhuman collaborators to create novel and unprecedented works of art? These questions, while complex\nand multifaceted, have significant implications for our understanding of the creative process and the\nrole of technology in artistic expression. In another unexpected direction, researchers have begun to explore the potential of using insect-\ninspired swarm intelligence for the creation of complex and adaptive narrative structures. By\nanalyzing the social dynamics and communication protocols of insect colonies, researchers have\ndeveloped novel methods for generating interactive and dynamic storylines, capable of responding\nto audience input and feedback. How can we ensure that these technologies are used\nresponsibly and for the greater good? These questions, while complex and challenging, must be\ncarefully considered as we move forward in this rapidly evolving field. By training insects\nto perform specific tasks or behaviors, researchers have been able to create intricate and complex\nperformances, featuring hundreds or even thousands of individual insects. As researchers continue to\npush the boundaries of this field, we can expect to see the development of increasingly sophisticated\nand adaptive systems, capable of manipulating and influencing audience emotional state in profound\nand unprecedented ways. 3 Methodology\nThe development of a swarm intelligence system for theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd\ncontrol is grounded in the principles of entomological hyperreality, where the boundaries between\nreality and simulation are deliberately blurred to create an immersive experience. To achieve this, we\nemployed a multi-faceted approach that combined insights from insect behavior, artificial intelligence,\nand theatrical design. Initially, we conducted an exhaustive study of various insect species, including\nbees, ants, and butterflies, to understand their communication patterns, social structures, and collective\ndecision-making processes. This involved observing and recording the behavior of these insects in\ncontrolled laboratory settings, as well as in their natural habitats, to identify patterns and traits that\ncould be applied to the development of a swarm intelligence system. One of the key challenges in this approach was translating the complex social behaviors of insects into\na language that could be understood and replicated by artificial intelligence algorithms. To address\nthis, we developed a novel framework that utilized a combination of machine learning techniques,\nincluding neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, to simulate the behavior of insect swarms. This involved using audio signals that mimicked the sounds produced\nby insects, such as buzzing, chirping, and hissing, to create an immersive sonic environment that\ncomplemented the visual effects of the swarm intelligence system. We hypothesized that this would\nenhance the emotional impact of the experience on the audience, by creating a more visceral and\nengaging connection to the simulation. The SC was\ndesigned to be highly intuitive and user-friendly, allowing even novice users to quickly and easily\ninteract with the simulation and create complex, dynamic lighting patterns. This created a form of \"feedback loop\" between the audience and the simulation,\nwhere the audience\u2019s emotions and responses could shape the behavior of the swarm, which in turn\ncould influence the audience\u2019s emotional state. Furthermore, the observation\n5that the system could be used to create a form of \"insect-inspired\" meditation or mindfulness practice,\nas well as a form of \"emotional symbiosis\" between the audience and the simulation, raises a number\nof interesting questions about the potential applications and implications of this technology in a\nvariety of fields, including therapy, education, and entertainment. Our research facility was transformed into a mock theater, complete with a stage, seating area,\nand state-of-the-art lighting system. We recruited 100 participants, divided into five groups, each\nwith a distinct personality type, as determined by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. We employed a novel approach, which we termed \"entomological\nentrainment,\" where the insects\u2019 bioluminescent outputs were synchronized with the brain waves of\nthe participants, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG). This allowed us to create a symphony\nof light and sound that was tailored to the collective emotional state of the audience. The ERI was calculated by analyzing the participants\u2019 EEG readings, heart\nrates, and self-reported emotional states, and then correlating these data with the swarm\u2019s behavior\nand lighting patterns. Future research directions will focus on refining the\nSwarmLux system, exploring its applications in other fields, such as psychology and neuroscience,\nand investigating the deeper implications of entomological emergence and collective euphoria. The implications of this discovery are\nprofound, suggesting that the emotional impact of theatrical performances can be precisely calibrated\nthrough the strategic manipulation of swarm intelligence parameters. While the scientific community may view these claims with a healthy\ndose of skepticism, our research suggests that the intersection of swarm intelligence, entomology,\nand theatrical performance may hold the key to unlocking previously unknown dimensions of human\nconsciousness. Ultimately, our research raises more questions than it answers, challenging us to reconsider our\nassumptions about the boundaries between technology, nature, and human experience. By harnessing the collective behavior of\nswarm systems, we have successfully created dynamic, adaptive lighting environments that not only\nrespond to the emotional state of the audience but also influence their emotional trajectories. As we continue\nto push the boundaries of this research, we are reminded that the most profound insights often\narise from the most unexpected places, and that the confluence of disparate disciplines can yield\nnovel, innovative solutions to complex problems.",
        "Results and Findings": "Interestingly, our preliminary findings suggest that the incorpora-\ntion of chaotic insect behavior can, in fact, yield a paradoxical sense of cohesion\nand unity among the audience members, despite the apparent lack of logical co-\nherence in the resulting lighting configurations. Furthermore, we observed that\nthe audience\u2019s emotional responses were, at times, more intensely influenced by\nthe swarm\u2019s erratic movements than by the actual theatrical performance, raising\nintriguing questions about the role of entropy and unpredictability in shaping the\nhuman emotional experience. For instance, a recent study found that the useof ant colony optimization algorithms can be used to create complex lighting patterns that mimic the\nbehavior of fireflies, which can be used to create a sense of enchantment and wonder in the audience. Research has shown\nthat the collective behavior of swarm systems, such as those exhibited by insects, can be leveraged to\ncreate complex and dynamic lighting patterns, capable of evoking powerful emotional responses in\nhuman audiences. By studying the pheromone-based communication protocols employed by ants, researchers\nhave developed novel algorithms for optimizing lighting configurations in real-time, taking into\naccount factors such as audience density, emotional state, and environmental conditions. These sounds, when integrated into\nthe theatrical experience, have been shown to have a profound impact on audience emotional state,\ninducing states of deep relaxation, heightened arousal, or even euphoria. By analyzing the collective behavior of insect\nswarms, researchers have identified key patterns and dynamics that can be leveraged to influence\nhuman crowd behavior. For instance, by releasing specific pheromone-like substances into the environment,\nresearchers have been able to induce a state of collective euphoria in audiences, characterized by\nincreased laughter, applause, and overall enthusiasm. By manipulating the strength, duration, and\npattern of these pheromone trails, we were able to influence the behavior of the simulated insect\nswarm, including its cohesion, movement, and decision-making processes. Specifically,\nwe found that the use of Stockhausen\u2019s \"Hymnen\" album as a soundtrack for the simulation resulted in\na significant increase in the complexity and diversity of the swarm behavior, including the emergence\nof novel patterns and structures that were not observed in the absence of the music. This was evident in the observation that users who interacted\nwith the SC for extended periods of time often reported feeling more calm, focused, and centered,\nas if they had undergone a form of meditation or therapeutic practice. Specifically, we observed that the audience\u2019s emotional responses to the simulation, as measured by\nphysiological sensors and surveys, could be used to influence the behavior of the simulated insect\nswarm in real-time. While the exact mechanisms underlying the behavior of the simulation are still not fully\nunderstood, the results of our research suggest that the system may be capable of exhibiting a form of\n\"emergent creativity\" and \"insect-inspired\" intuition, which could have significant implications for\nthe development of future theatrical lighting and sound design systems. 4 Experiments\nTo investigate the efficacy of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd\ncontrol, we conducted a series of experiments that pushed the boundaries of conventional methodolo-\ngies. In a surprising turn of events, our experiments revealed that the SwarmLux system was capable\nof inducing a state of \"collective euphoria\" in the participants, characterized by elevated levels of\ndopamine, serotonin, and endorphins. However, this effect was only observed when the insects were\nfed a diet of pure honey and played a constant loop of ambient music. We also discovered that the\nsystem\u2019s performance was significantly enhanced when the participants were asked to wear funny\nhats, which, according to our findings, increased the \"laughter-induced neuroplasticity\" of the brain. One of the most intriguing results emerged when we introduced a \"rogue insect\" into the swarm,\nprogrammed to behave erratically and disrupt the otherwise harmonious patterns. Our results showed a strong positive correlation between the ERI and the\nlevel of \"swarm coherence,\" which we defined as the degree of synchronization between the insects\u2019\nmovements and the audience\u2019s emotional responses. The presence of the rogue\ninsect also appeared to have a positive effect on the ERI, particularly in the group with the highest\nlevel of swarm coherence (Group E). While our findings may seem unconventional and even absurd at times, they underscore the im-\nportance of exploring novel and innovative approaches to understanding the complex relationships\nbetween humans, insects, and technology. 5 Results\nThe utilization of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd control has\nyielded a plethora of fascinating results, challenging our conventional understanding of the intricate\nrelationships between insect behavior, lighting design, and human emotions. Further investigation into the entomological resonance phenomenon revealed a curious correlation\nbetween the fractal dimensions of the swarm patterns and the resultant emotional states of the audience. Specifically, it was found that swarm patterns exhibiting a fractal dimension of approximately 1.67\nwere most effective in inducing a state of profound melancholy, while those with a fractal dimension\nof 2.13 were more likely to elicit feelings of joy and elation. The results of these\nexperiments were nothing short of astonishing, with audience members reporting a range of bizarre\nand fantastical experiences, including vivid hallucinations, temporary synesthesia, and even apparent\nepisodes of collective telepathy. One of the most unexpected outcomes of our research was the discovery that the swarm intelligence\nsystem could be \"hacked\" by introducing a small number of rogue insects into the system. These\nrogue insects, which we term \"entomological anomalies,\" were found to have a profound impact on\nthe overall behavior of the swarm, often inducing chaotic and unpredictable patterns that challenged\nour initial assumptions about the stability and reliability of the system. The following table summarizes the results of our experiments with different swarm intelligence\nparameters and their corresponding effects on audience emotions: These findings have significant\nTable 2: Swarm Intelligence Parameters and Corresponding Emotional Effects\nSwarm Parameter Fractal Dimension Emotional Effect\nMonarch Butterfly Migration 1.67 Melancholy\nFirefly Flashing Patterns 2.13 Elation\nGlowworm Bioluminescence 1.32 Serenity\nEntomological Anomalies N/A Chaos/Unpredictability\nGenetically Engineered Super-Firefly N/A Awe/Amazement\nimplications for the development of novel theatrical lighting systems, suggesting that the strategic\n7manipulation of swarm intelligence parameters can be used to elicit a wide range of emotional\nresponses from audience members. One of the most unexpected outcomes of our research was the discovery that the incorporation of\nswarm intelligence in stage lighting design can induce a state of \"entomological entrainment\" in\nspectators, wherein their emotional responses become synchronized with the rhythmic patterns of\ninsect behavior. Furthermore, our experiments have revealed a curious correlation between the fractal dimensions of\nstage lighting patterns and the emergence of complex emotional states in the audience. Specifically,\nwe have found that lighting designs exhibiting a fractal dimension of 1.57 \u00b10.03 tend to elicit feelings\nof euphoria and wonder, while those with a fractal dimension of 2.13 \u00b10.05 are more likely to induce\nstates of melancholy and introspection. While the underlying mechanisms driving this correlation are\nnot yet fully understood, our results suggest that the judicious manipulation of fractal dimensions in\nstage lighting design can serve as a powerful tool for emotional crowd control. Preliminary results indicate that the use of swarm-based\nlighting systems can enhance the overall verisimilitude of these performances, creating an uncanny\nsense of insect-like authenticity that is both captivating and unsettling. In addition to these findings, our study has highlighted the importance of considering the \"entomo-\nlogical uncanny\" in the design of swarm-based stage lighting systems. 8",
        "Conclusion": "6In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate the potential of swarm intelligence and entomological\nhyperreality in creating immersive and emotionally resonant experiences for theatrical audiences. 6 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, our exploration of entomological hyperreality through the lens of swarm intelligence\nfor theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd control has yielded a plethora of intriguing findings,\nchallenging conventional notions of performance and audience engagement. Ultimately, our exploration of entomological hyperreality has opened up new avenues of inquiry at\nthe intersection of swarm intelligence, stage lighting, and emotional crowd control."

        "Abstract": "A PyTorch-Based Approach for Variational Learning\nwith Disentanglement\nAbstract\nThis paper presents the Disentanglement-PyTorch library, which has been devel-\noped to assist in the research, application, and assessment of novel variational\nalgorithms. Appendix A.",
        "Methodology": "This modular library allows for independent and reliable experimen-\ntation across diverse variational methodologies, through the decoupling of neural\narchitectures, the dimensionality of the latent space, and training algorithms. It also provides evaluation\nof the encodings using various disentanglement metrics. Currently, the library\nincludes implementations of the following unsupervised algorithms: V AE, \u03b2-V AE,\nFactor-V AE, DIP-I-V AE, DIP-II-V AE, Info-V AE, and \u03b2-TCV AE. One path concentrates\non learning transformations that are specific to a given task, often optimized for particular domains\nand applications. The other path involves learning the inherent factors of variation, in a manner\nthat is both disentangled and task-invariant. This work introduces a library developed\nusing the functionalities of the PyTorch framework. This library has been designed to facilitate the\nresearch, implementation, and evaluation of new variational algorithms, with a specific emphasis\non representation learning and disentanglement. 2 Library Features\n2.1 Supported Algorithms and Objective Functions\n2.1.1 Unsupervised Objectives\nThe library currently offers implementations of the following unsupervised variational algorithms:\nV AE, \u03b2-V AE, \u03b2-TCV AE, Factor-V AE, Info-V AE, DIP-I-V AE, and DIP-II-V AE. Consequently, if the loss terms from two learning algorithms (e.g., A and B)\nare compatible, they can be integrated into the objective function by setting the appropriate flag. This\nallows researchers to combine loss terms that optimize for related objectives. .2.1.2 Conditional and Attribute-variant Objectives\nThe library provides support for conditional methods such as CV AE, where extra known attributes (i.e.,\nlabels) are utilized in both the encoding and decoding procedures. It also offers support for IFCV AE. This is a method that enforces certain latent factors to encode known attributes through a set of positive\nand negative discriminators in a supervised manner. The library\u2019s modular construction allows the\nuse of any of the previously mentioned unsupervised loss terms in conjunction with conditional and\ninformation factorization techniques. This allows for the encouragement of disentanglement across\nattribute-invariant latents. This design enables the independent investigation of\nnew architectures for encoder and decoder networks, as well as support for diverse data domains. The capacity, which is defined as\nthe distance between the prior and the latent posterior distributions and represented with the variable\nC, is incrementally increased throughout training. The emphasis can be progressively shifted toward the disentanglement term\nas training proceeds. Researchers are encouraged to use the\ndynamic learning rate scheduling to reduce the rate gradually. This should be done when the average\nobjective function over the epoch ceases its decreasing trend. 2.4.4 Logging and Visualization\nThe library utilizes a tool to log the training process and visualizations. It allows the visualization\nof condition traversals, latent factor traversals, and output reconstructions in both static images and\nanimated GIFs. Given the limited 8-hour timeframe\nallocated for training, the model was pre-trained on the mpi3d toy dataset. The model was trained\nusing the Adam optimizer for a total of 90,000 iterations, with a batch size of 64. The learning rate was initially set to 0.001. The capacity parameter, C, was\nincreased gradually from 0 to 25. The dimensionality of the z-space was set to 20. 2The encoder comprised 5 convolutional layers. The number of kernels increased gradually from 32 to\n256. This layer was used to estimate the posterior\nlatent distribution as a parametric Gaussian. The decoder network included one convolutional layer. This was followed by 6 deconvolutional (transposed convolutional) layers. The number of kernels\ngradually decreased from 256 down to the number of channels in the image space. ReLU activations\nwere used for all layers, except for the final layers of both the encoder and decoder networks. This is despite the fact that the model was only pre-trained using the mpi3d toy dataset. It incorporates implementations of several well-\nknown algorithms, along with a variety of evaluation metrics. The disentanglement is not complete as some features are encoded in the same latent\nfactor. A latent space of size 20 was used, however, changes in the other 13 latent factors had no\neffect on the reconstruction; thus, these feature-invariant factors were not included for brevity.",
        "Results and Findings": "They are specified by their\nrespective loss terms. 3 Experiments and Results\nThe\u03b2-TCV AE algorithm yielded the most effective disentanglement outcomes on the mpi3d real\ndataset during the second phase of the disentanglement challenge. It was reduced\nby a factor of 0.95 when the objective function reached a plateau. The model consistently performed better on the mpi3d realistic and mpi3d real\ndatasets. Table 1: Results of the best configurations of \u03b2-TCV AE on DCI, FactorV AE, SAP, MIG, and IRS\nmetrics. This makes it a valuable resource for\nthe research community.",

        "Methodology": "To measure this divide, we construct a citation graph, compare\nit to European connectivity, and discuss both the causes and consequences of this\nseparation. Despite China\u2019s position as a leader in AI research, collaborations between Chinese and American\ninstitutions are less common than collaborations between American and Western European institutions. This separation is not limited to just social interactions. Although many non-native\nEnglish speakers find it a challenge to speak in public, avoiding talks by Chinese researchers may\nlimit a conference attendee\u2019s exposure to new topics and ideas. This study measures the separation between researchers in China and the United States. 2 Citation Networks\n2.1 Methods\nTo quantify the divide between the regions, we compiled a citation graph using NeurIPS paper\ncitation data from SemanticScholar and institutional information about authors from AMiner. We then used the S2AG API to identify the authors of each paper as well as the\nauthors of papers referenced by these papers. The 4038 papers lacking\nauthor information were excluded from the dataset. We then automatically identified institutes that\nincluded a country name, along with common cities and regions in China. We augmented these\nautomatic annotations with existing regional matchings and added 364 additional rules. Of the remaining 5422 papers, we removed papers that were not from China, the US, or\nEurope, or included collaborators in multiple regions, leaving 1792 papers. While American\npapers constitute 60% of our dataset, they only account for 34% of citations made by Chinese papers. This is more profound when\ncomparing these values to American citations of European papers: even though the dataset has\nsix times more Chinese than European papers, American institutions cite Chinese papers less than\nEuropean papers. The division between American and Chinese research communities\nis much more pronounced than one would expect based on typical regional preferences. While\nAmerican and European research communities show similar citation behavior, Chinese institutions\ncite American and European papers less than other regions. USA China Europe\nUSA 41 9 12\nChina 34 21 6\nEurope 15 9 14\nTable 1: Proportion of papers from given regions citing other regions or endogenously. First, while we consider institutions in the US as American, many US labs have\nclose ties to China, potentially underestimating the true divide. Some US labs are largely or entirely\nmade up of Chinese international students. Second, a number of papers were excluded from our analysis due to missing author information on\nAMiner, which is a Chinese platform. To some degree, this can be attributed to different research interests due to cultural\nnorms influencing research priorities. However, due to concerns surrounding privacy and\nmisuse, many North American researchers tend to avoid related topics. In general, the US tends to be\nheavily represented at fairness conferences, while representation from China is limited. Recently, the North American and European AI communities have increasingly engaged in conversa-\ntions regarding the ethical considerations of AI and have adopted review systems for ethical concerns\n2and required authors to include ethics statements. However, there has been limited engagement\nwith researchers from China regarding these topics, and ethics statements for Chinese-based AI\ninstitutions are similar to western ones. For instance, while Duke University stopped providing the Duke-MTMC\ndataset, due to the ethical issues with the collection process, similar datasets from Chinese institutions\ncontinue to be actively used. The separation between the research communities has an impact on both researchers and societies as\na whole.

        "Results and Findings": "China is now consistently the second-largest contributor of publications at\nNeurIPS, following the United States. In 2020, 13.6% of all NeurIPS publications came from Chinese\ninstitutions. The next year, this increased to 17.5%, a relative increase of 28.7%. A prominent professor in an\napplied area of machine learning publicly advised students to avoid talks by Chinese authors, arguing\nthat their presentations would be difficult to understand or of poor quality. We use\nNeurIPS citation data to analyze the impact of work from US-based and China-based institutions,\nand find that Chinese institutions under-cite work from the US and Europe, and that both American\nand European institutions under-cite work from China. We\nfirst collected all paper titles from NeurIPS from 2012 to 2021 from the NeurIPS website. Using\nthe Semantic Scholar Academic Graph (S2AG) API, we then mapped paper titles to their Semantic\nScholar paper IDs. For unmatched papers we manually searched, finding all but one in the Semantic\nScholar database. We used AMiner to identify institutional information for each author. The 9460 NeurIPS papers have\n135,941 authors in total, of which we found institutions for 83,515 (61%). American citations of Chinese papers are even more striking: while Chinese papers account for\n34% of our dataset, they are only cited in 9% of American references. We also observe that each region tends to cite its own papers more often: 21% for China, 41% for\nthe USA, and 14% for Europe. In addition, our filtering of\nmultinational corporate labs may be incomplete which could also affect our results. It is crucial that the AI community initiates a discussion to overcome this barrier.

        "Abstract": "An Empirical Study of the \"Hard-Won Lesson\": Two\nDecades of Research Insights\nAbstract\nThis research investigates the congruence between research in major computer\nvision conferences and the tenets of the \"hard-won lesson\" articulated by Rich\nSutton. Utilizing large language models (LLMs), we scrutinize twenty years of\nabstracts and titles from these conferences to evaluate the field\u2019s acceptance of these\ncore concepts. In this article, we explore the degree to which the abstracts from a prominent machine learning (ML)\nconference align with the principles of the \"hard-won lesson\" across two decades. Our analysis\nencompasses a randomized selection of 200 papers annually, addressing these research questions:\n\u2022 How has the emphasis on generalized methodologies and computational approaches devel-\noped in major computer vision conference abstracts over the last 20 years? \u2022To what degree do the abstracts mirror the primary observations of Sutton\u2019s \"hard-won\nlesson,\" and how has this correlation altered over time? To tackle these inquiries, we utilize large language models (LLMs), themselves a clear demonstration\nof the principles delineated in the \"hard-won lesson,\" to scrutinize the abstracts. 2.3 Large Language Models in Academic Evaluation\nThe incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the assessment of scholarly texts has\nbecome a notable area of focus. The following details are extracted\nfrom online sources and stored in a database for each paper: Year of Publication (2005-2024), Title,\nAuthors, and Abstract. First, our reliance on large language models (LLMs) for evaluating\nresearch abstracts introduces potential biases inherent to these models. Furthermore, our analysis is limited to the information contained in titles and abstracts, which may\nnot capture the full depth and nuance of the methodologies and findings presented in the full papers. No\npersonally identifiable information was collected from human subjects.",
        "Methodology": "Our approach employs cutting-edge natural language processing\nmethodologies to methodically chart the progression of research paradigms within\ncomputer vision. This investigation contributes to the persistent\ndiscourse regarding the most efficacious methods for propelling machine learning\nand computer vision forward, furnishing perspectives that could steer forthcoming\nresearch orientations and techniques in these domains. \u2022What discernible patterns can be observed regarding the embrace of deep learning method-\nologies and the departure from manually constructed features? \u2022Does a substantial correlation exist between a paper\u2019s alignment with the \"hard-won lesson\"\nprinciples and its influence, as gauged by its citation count? This assessment\nhinges on five metrics assigned by the LLMs, offering a thorough evaluation of the congruence\nbetween the abstracts and the \"hard-won lesson.\" By employing LLMs to analyze a substantial\n.corpus of research literature, we introduce an innovative method for comprehending the learning and\nprogression of a scientific field. This technique enables us to detect patterns and trends that might\nelude conventional research approaches, thereby delivering a more holistic understanding of the\ncurrent state of ML research and its alignment with the principles demonstrated to be most effective\nin driving AI advancements. By pinpointing trends in the adoption of generalized methods and deep learning techniques, we can\ncontribute to the advancement of foundational CV models at the cutting edge. Sutton\u2019s central idea underscores the\nimportance of generalized methods that utilize computational capability over human-engineered\nrepresentations and domain-specific expertise. This viewpoint resonates with Leo Breiman\u2019s earlier\nwork, which, twenty years prior, outlined the distinction between statistical and algorithmic methods\nin his paper \"Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures.\" Breiman\u2019s insights, along with subsequent\ncontributions, have significantly influenced our comprehension of data-oriented approaches in AI. Historically dependent on manually designed features such as SIFT, HOG,\nand Haar cascades for object recognition and image categorization, CV experienced a transformation\nwith the introduction of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The emergence of foundational models further aligned CV with Sutton\u2019s principles. Models like\nCLIP, ALIGN, and Florence demonstrate remarkable adaptability across diverse tasks with minimal\nfine-tuning, leveraging extensive multi-modal datasets to learn rich, transferable representations. This progression from conventional feature engineering to deep learning and foundational models\nin CV highlights the significance of employing computational resources and extensive datasets to\nachieve enhanced performance and generalization. LLMs, like GPT-4, have shown impressive abilities in swiftly handling\nand examining vast quantities of data, making them appropriate for numerous uses, including the\nevaluation of academic papers. However, deploying LLMs in academic evaluation is not without its\nchallenges. LLMs can exhibit biases similar to those found in human judgments, which may affect\nthe fairness and accuracy of their evaluations. The function of LLMs in responding to inquiries and formulating hypotheses also deserves considera-\ntion. Their capacity to furnish comprehensive answers to intricate queries has been utilized in diverse\neducational environments, enhancing learning experiences and facilitating knowledge acquisition. In\nthe context of academic research, LLMs can aid in generating hypotheses and guiding exploratory\nstudies, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in various fields. 2Despite the promising applications of LLMs in academic evaluation and research, it is crucial to\nestablish ethical guidelines and best practices for their use. 3 Methodology and Evaluation\n3.1 LLM Evaluation of Titles and Abstracts\nWe utilize three large language models to assess the titles and abstracts of papers: GPT-4o-2024-05-\n13, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, and claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620. Additionally, the citation count for each paper is obtained from the Semantic\nScholar API on July 20th, 2024, and recorded alongside the other metadata. Each LLM is assigned the task of providing a Likert score ranging from 0 to 10, indicating the degree\nto which a paper corresponds with the principles outlined in Sutton\u2019s \"hard-won lesson.\" We employ\nthe Chain-of-Thought Prompting method in conjunction with the Magentic library to interact with\nthe models and accumulate their feedback in a structured manner for subsequent analysis. We establish five dimensions for alignment with the \"hard-won lesson\":\n1. **Learning Over Engineering:** How much does the idea prioritize using computation through\ndata-driven learning and statistical methods over human-engineered knowledge and domain expertise? **Search over Heuristics:** To what extent does the idea emphasize leveraging computation\nthrough search algorithms and optimization techniques instead of relying on human-designed heuris-\ntics? **Generality\nover Specificity:** How much does the approach emphasize general, flexible methods that learn from\ndata rather than building complex models of the world through manual engineering? **Favoring\nFundamental Principles:** To what extent does the approach adhere to fundamental principles of\ncomputation and information theory rather than emulating human cognition? The prompts were crafted to encapsulate the core of each \"hard-won lesson\" dimension in a succinct\nand impartial manner. Given the large number of publications, our research concentrates on a representative random sample\nof 200 papers from each year. We define the overall alignment score for each paper as the sum of\nscores across the five dimensions. 3.2 Inter-rater Reliability Measures\n**Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC):** We employ ICC to measure the level of agreement\namong the models\u2019 evaluations. ICC is especially fitting for evaluating reliability when numerous\nraters assess an identical set of items. Specifically, we utilize the two-way random effects model\n(ICC(2,k)) to consider both rater and subject influences. **Krippendorff\u2019s Alpha:** In addition to ICC, we compute Krippendorff\u2019s Alpha, a flexible reliability\ncoefficient capable of managing diverse data types (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio) and resilient to\nmissing data. 3.3 Regression Analysis\nTo examine the connection between alignment scores and a paper\u2019s impact, we conduct a regression\nanalysis, using citation count as an indicator of influence. To manage the publication year and address\npotential temporal effects, we incorporate yearly stratification into our regression model. This method\nenables us to isolate the influence of alignment while accounting for the differing citation patterns\nacross various publication years. To tackle the typically right-skewed distribution of citation counts, we employ a logarithmic transfor-\nmation on the data. This transformation achieves several objectives in our analysis: it diminishes\nskewness, yielding a more symmetrical distribution that more closely resembles normality; it stabi-\n3lizes variance across the data range, reducing the heteroscedasticity often seen in citation count data\nwhere variance tends to rise with the mean; and it linearizes potentially multiplicative relationships,\nconverting them into additive ones. Although perfect agreement is not achieved, the inter-reliability measures fall within or above\ncommon thresholds for \"good\" reliability, validating the use of AI models for prompt-based research\npaper evaluation. The R-squared values range from\n0.027 to 0.306. In this regression analysis, a multiplicative effect implies that a one-unit change in the alignment\nscore for a particular dimension leads to a proportional change in the original scale of the citation\ncount. The statistical significance of the regression coefficients is denoted using , , and to represent the\n10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels, respectively. The R-squared values are quite low for most years but\nincrease substantially starting in 2015. 4.3 Trends in \"Hard-Won Lesson\" Alignment\nThe dimensions of \"Scalability with Computation\" and \"Learning Over Engineering\" show a consis-\ntent upward trend over the years. The period from 2015 to 2020 witnesses a particularly sharp rise in\nthe average scores for these dimensions.

Second, the absence of human\nexpert evaluation as a ground truth is a significant limitation. Lastly, while our study spans two decades of proceedings, it does not account for research published\nin other venues or unpublished work that may have influenced the field. Despite these limitations, we believe our study provides valuable insights into broad trends in\ncomputer vision research and its alignment with the principles of the \"hard-won lesson.\" Future\nwork could address these limitations by incorporating human expert evaluations, analyzing full paper\ncontents, and expanding the scope to include a wider range of publication venues. Our use of large language models (LLMs) for analyzing\ntrends in academic literature raises important ethical considerations. We acknowledge that LLMs\nmay introduce biases when used for direct evaluation of academic work. However, our study focuses\nsolely on using LLMs to analyze broad trends rather than to assess individual papers\u2019 quality or merit. All data were collected in accordance with applicable privacy and intellectual property laws. Our methodology aims to\n5Table 2: Regression analysis results for the relationship between overall \"hard-won lesson\" alignment\nscores and citation impact, stratified by year. minimize risks by using multiple models and focusing on aggregate trends rather than individual\nassessments.",

        "Abstract": "Privacy Evaluation in Tabular Synthetic Data:\nCurrent Approaches and Future Directions\nAbstract\nThis paper examines the present methods for quantifying the level of privacy\nprotection offered by tabular synthetic data (SD). Currently, there is no standardized\napproach for measuring the degree of privacy protection these datasets offer. While several surveys mention privacy as a use case for SD, they do not cover its assessment in a\ndetailed way. 2 Definitions and Notation\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is currently no widely accepted definition of SD. Records that emerge\nin isolation with little variability in their attribute values are difficult to generalize. Threat models also include scenarios where an adversary uses auxiliary\ninformation and can be:\n\u2013No box: the adversary only has access to the SD. \u2013Black box: the adversary also has limited generator access (no access to the model\nclass or parameters, but access to the model \u02d82019s input-output relation). The system is considered DP if the released information does\nnot significantly change when one record is removed from the dataset. 4.2 k-Anonymity\nPrivacy risks persist, even if identifying attributes are removed. Absolute metrics include the probability with which records can be singled\nout, and the proportion of real records that can be re-identified. A random baseline approach\nuses random guessing to determine how effective an attack is. In addition, k-anonymity is a\nproperty of synthetic data, and not the methods to produce them. There are currently no studies that assess whether seed-based generators inherently pose greater risks\nthan other generators. 7.3 Suggestions for Future Research\nFor the future research directions we identify are:\n\u2022Standardizing privacy assessment: More interdisciplinary research is required to develop\nan inclusive understanding of synthetic data.",
        "Methodology": "This\ndiscussion contributes to the development of SD privacy standards, encourages\ninterdisciplinary discourse, and aids SD researchers in making well-informed\nchoices concerning modeling and assessment. However, the wide variety of SD generation\napproaches makes the degree of privacy protection they offer difficult to assess. Therefore, this paper\noutlines the typical technical assessment frameworks for individual privacy in SD sets. This increases\ninterdisciplinary awareness of privacy in SD and helps SD researchers make informed modeling and\nassessment choices. In addition, reviews of privacy in AI fail to mention SD, and surveys, reviews, and\nexperimental comparisons of SD techniques often do not focus on privacy metrics. Rows d\u2208Dare|A(D)|-\ntuples, with a value v(d, a)for each attribute a\u2208A(D). We denote by Ga generator, and \u02c6D\u223cG(D)to represent a synthetic dataset \u02c6D\nobtained from generator Gtrained on D. Seed-based generators are a specific type of generators that\nproduce a unique synthetic record denoted by G(d)for every real record d. This is different from\nmost models (e.g., GANs, V AEs) which probabilistically represent overall dataset properties and\nproduce synthetic data by sampling from the obtained distribution. .3 Synthetic Data Privacy Risks\nThree significant risks identified in prior works serve as a basis for a proper anonymization. Privacy risks in SD can occur due to various factors,\nwhich include:\n\u2022Model and data properties: Improperly trained generators may overfit, memorizing and\nreproducing training data rather than inferring them stochastically. As\nsuch, datasets containing outliers or sparse data are more at risk of memorization than more\nhomogeneous sets. \u2022The approach to data synthesis: Most generators create stochastic models of datasets,\ncreating synthetic records via sampling. This detaches real data subjects from synthetic\nrecords. However, some methods create a single synthetic record for each real record. In such cases,\nthe SD resembles a small selection of real data subjects well, but not the entire population. This causes data clutter around specific real records, leaking their information. This can range from no access to the generator, to full knowledge including\nmodel parameters. \u2013White box: the adversary has full generator access (model class and parameters). \u2013Any of the aforementioned, along with auxiliary information, which is formalized in\nthe definition of auxiliary information in Definition 3.1. Suppose there are two real datasets, DandD\u2032, with D\u2032=D\\ {d}. A generator Gis considered DP if a data controller with access to \u02c6D\u223cGcannot infer if Gwas\ntrained on DorD\u2032. Approaches to train generators with built-in mechanisms to guarantee DP can be\nfound in the literature. In this context, DP is a property of generators, not of the synthetic data they\nproduce. Combinations of attribute values may\nstill be used to single out an individual. A dataset is k-anonymous if at least k individuals share each combination of attribute values. Further restrictions such as l-diversity, t-closeness, and ( \u03b1, k)-anonymity have been introduced to\noffer additional protection. Synthetic data based on autoregressive models can implement k-anonymity directly into the generation\nprocess. 4.3 Plausible Deniability\nA degree of plausible deniability is inherent in synthetic datasets, as their records do not pertain to\nreal data subjects. For any dataset Dwhere |D|> k, and any\nrecord \u02c6dsuch that \u02c6d=G(d1)ford1\u2208D, we say that \u02c6dis releasable with (k, \u03b3)-plausible deniability\nif there exist at least k\u22121distinct records d2, ..., d k\u2208D\\ {d1}such that for all i, j\u2208 {1,2, ..., k}:\nP[d=G(di)]\u2248\u03b3P[d=G(dj)]\nIn other words, a generator producing synthetic records from a seed has PD if, for each synthetic\nrecord produced from a particular seed, kother seeds could have resulted in roughly the same\n(quantified through \u03b3) synthetic record. Unlike DP and PD, these indicators measure properties of synthetic datasets, not their\ngenerators. These can be classified based on the following properties, summarized in Table\n3 of Appendix C:\n\u2022Similarity metrics. Several approaches exist, such as binning numeric attributes; com-\nbining multiple metrics; ignoring specific attributes; or evaluating distances in embedding\nspaces. For a given synthetic record \u02c6d\u2208\u02c6D, we can find its closest real record\nd\u2208D. Similarly, the smallest synthetic-to-synthetic (SSD), real-to-synthetic (RSD), and real-to-real\ndistance (RRD) can be defined. \u2022Use of holdout sets. To compute the RRD, the real data Dcan be partitioned into two subsets\nD1andD2. Measures used for this include medians, means, and standard deviations. It measures how often synthetic parameter values correspond to real values in l-diverse\nequivalence classes. Furthermore, there are several probabilistic techniques to quantify the risks by\nusing real hold-out sets as baselines. Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) can be also used as a\nprivacy metric to test if the generator overfits. 6 Computer Scientific Experimental Privacy Assessment\nComputer-scientific privacy assessment involves performing privacy attacks using synthetic data. The effectiveness of these attacks is used to measure the degree of protection SD provides. \u2022Baselines and Effectiveness Estimation. The efficacy of a model can be measured in a few\ndifferent ways. In a control baseline, the real\ndata is split into a training set and a control set. A model is trained on the training set, and\nthen the estimated success rate of attacks is compared on the training and control data sets. 6.1 Relation to WP29 Attack Types\n\u2022Singling out. VRD attacks directly implement singling-out attacks, identifying outlier SD\nrecords. Anonymeter and information theory based VRD are the only methods that\nexplicitly model linkage attacks. Large parameter values offer weak privacy guarantees, and a given \u03f5can\nresult in different degrees of protection depending on the application. Plausible deniability (PD) is only\napplicable to seed-based methods. It shares properties with both DP and k-anonymity, making a\nrecord protected if it can be confused with other records. Computer-scientific experiments allow for flexible modeling using various threat models, and can\ninclude properties of both synthetic data and their generators. DP measures the impact of individual training records, with\noutliers having large impacts, and both k-anonymity and PD focus on limiting the uniqueness of\nrecords. Furthermore, some methods\nexplicitly search for outliers. \u2022Synergies between assessments: A comparison between mathematical, statistical, and\nempirical approaches would be useful to evaluate their consistency, and to identify their\nindividual merits and weaknesses. Experiments should use open-source generators and\npublicly available datasets. Future research should\nfocus on incorporating these, by integrating metrics in loss functions, or by combinatorial\noptimization. \u2022Assessment for advanced data formats: More work is needed to assess privacy in relational\ndatasets that have information contained in multiple, interconnected tables. \u2022Distribution-level confidentiality: There is a need for frameworks that assess the confiden-\ntiality of overall dataset properties. The safe predictor\nshares this structure with constrained predictors, G0andG1, but each predictor has its own fully\nconnected layer. The training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space and the learned\npredictors are shown for the continuous input space. The constrained\npredictors G00,G10,G01andG11share the hidden layers and have an additional hidden layer of size\n20 with ReLU followed by a fully connected layer. Again, training uses a sampled subset of points\nfrom the input space and the learned predictors are shown for the continuous input space. If no future advisories exist,\nthe advisory is \"unsafeable\" and the corresponding input region is the \"unsafeable region\". The constraints we enforce in our safe predictor are: x\u2208Aunsafeable ,i\u21d2Fi(x)<max jFj(x),\n\u2200i. To make the output regions convex, we approximate by enforcing Fi(x) = min jFj(x), for all\nx\u2208Aunsafeable ,i.\nC.2 Proximity Functions\nWe start by generating the unsafeable region bounds. Then, a distance function is computed between\npoints in the input space ( vO\u2212vI, h,\u03c4), and the unsafeable region for each advisory. These are not\ntrue distances, but are 0 if and only if the data point is within the unsafeable set. C.3 Structure of Predictors\nThe compressed policy tables for ACAS Xu and VerticalCAS use neural networks with six hidden\nlayers with a dimension of 45, and ReLU activation functions. For constrained predictors, we use a similar architecture, but share the first\nfour layers for all predictors. This provides a common learned representation of the input space, while\nallowing each predictor to adapt to its constraints. Each constrained predictor has two additional\nhidden layers and their outputs are projected onto our convex approximation of the safe output region,\nusing Gb(x) = min jGj(x)\u2212\u03f5. With this construction, we needed 30 separate predictors to enforce the VerticalCAS safeability\nconstraints. The number of nodes for the unconstrained and safe implementations were 270 and\n2880, respectively. Our safe predictor is smaller than the original look-up tables by several orders of\nmagnitude. C.4 Parameter Optimization\nWe use PyTorch for defining our networks and performing parameter optimization. We optimize both\nthe unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric loss function, guiding the\n6network to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores from the look-up tables. Each\ndataset is split using an 80/20 train/test split with a random seed of 0.",
        "Results and Findings": "(Synthetic data) Synthetic data (SD) are data generated through a purpose-built\nmathematical model or algorithm (the \"generator\"), intended to solve a set of data science tasks. Such datasets are also more susceptible to singling-out. Definition 3.1. Definition 4.1. Definition 4.2. Because structured datasets can have a mix of different datatypes, metric\nevaluation is complex. The distance between these records is the synthetic to real distance (SRD) of \u02c6d, and\nis denoted as SRD (\u02c6d):\nSRD (\u02c6d) := min\nd\u2208DDist(\u02c6d, d) \u2200\u02c6d\u2208\u02c6D. For a real record d1\u2208D1, the RRD is the smallest distance to any record\nd2\u2208D2:\nRRD (d1) := min\nd2\u2208D2Dist(d1, d2) \u2200d1\u2208D1. 3\u2022Statistics. Machine\nlearning (ML) techniques are another approach, where classifiers are trained to re-identify\nreal data subjects. Statistical indicators measure properties of the synthetic data, and not\ntheir generators. Distance-based indicators are sensitive to outliers, because synthetic neighbors of outliers\nhave small SRDs, while the RRD of corresponding real outliers is large. Standards should be developed for research\nfindings to be more easily interpreted, and there should be a consensus formed over whether\nprivacy is a property of synthetic datasets, the generators, or both. It would also be useful to include information regarding the used\nmetrics, and the use of a holdout set, and the statistical interpretation of the results.

In our experiments, we used \u03f5= 0.0001 . 7",

The development of novel, computer-aided, fossil reconstruction techniques, incorporating elements\nof artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cognitive psychology, enabled us to recreate, with\nunprecedented accuracy, the appearance and behavior of extinct, fossilized species, which, when\nextrapolated to the realm of science fiction, yielded a series of thought-provoking, philosophical\nscenarios, exploring the potential consequences of reviving, through advanced, biotechnology, an\nancient, fossilized ecosystem, and the implications of such a scenario for our understanding of\nthe intricate, web-like relationships between species, ecosystems, and the planet as a whole.

A comprehensive, comparative analysis of the fossil records from diverse, planetary environments,\nincluding Mars, Europa, and Titan, revealed a surprising, universal pattern of convergence, wherein\nthe evolutionary trajectories of disparate, alien species were, in fact, recapitulating the history of life\non Earth, as if the universe itself was, in some mysterious, unexplained way, guiding the evolution of\nlife towards a common, cosmic goal, whose nature and significance remained shrouded in mystery,\nyet seemed to be connected to the enigmatic, symbolic language of fossilized, megastructures, whose\nmeaning and purpose continued to elude us, like a will-o\u2019-the-wisp, beckoning us deeper into the\nlabyrinthine, surreal landscape of the unknown. The incorporation of advanced, geospatial analysis techniques to the study of fossil distributions\nenabled us to detect the presence of anomalous, non-random patterns, whose origin and significance\nremained unclear, yet seemed to be connected to the distribution of certain, rare, and enigmatic, fossil\nspecies, whose existence and behavior continued to intrigue and mystify us, like a series of, cryptic,\nfossilized, messages from the depths of time, whose meaning and significance awaited deciphering,\nlike a, yet, unsolved, puzzle, or a, yet, uncracked, code. As our research continued to unfold, like\na, labyrinthine, surrealist, tapestry, we encountered an array of, bizarre, unexplained, phenomena,\nincluding the spontaneous, levitation of fossil fragments, the emission of anomalous, low-frequency\nradiation from fossil matrices, and the appearance of, cryptic, hieroglyphic, inscriptions on the surface\nof fossilized, tree trunks, which, when deciphered, revealed a hidden, esoteric knowledge, that had\nbeen encoded into the fossil record, by an ancient, lost civilization, whose technological prowess had\nenabled them to transcend the boundaries of space and time, leaving behind a legacy of, enigmatic,\nfossilized artifacts, that continued to intrigue, mystify, and inspire us. The development of new methodologies for analyzing the fossil record has been facilitated by\nadvances in technology, including the use of high-performance computing and advanced software\npackages, which, when used in conjunction with other tools and techniques, can provide a detailed\nand nuanced picture of the evolution of life on Earth, a topic that continues to be the subject of intense\nscientific scrutiny and investigation, as researchers seek to answer some of the most fundamental and\nenduring questions about the nature of life and the universe, including the question of whether or not\nwe are alone in the universe, a topic that has been the subject of much speculation and debate, and\nwhich, when considered in the context of the fossil record, suggests that the emergence of complex\nlife forms on Earth may have been influenced by a variety of factors, including the presence of\ncertain types of minerals and nutrients in the primordial oceans, which, when combined with the\nenergy from sunlight and the chemical reactions that occurred on the early Earth, gave rise to the first\nself-replicating molecules, a process that, over time, led to the development of increasingly complex\norganisms, including the earliest forms of life that are preserved in the fossil record, which, when\nstudied and analyzed using advanced techniques and methodologies, provide a unique window into\nthe history of our planet and the evolution of life on Earth. Only about how to solve the problem. The journey of discovery that has led us to this point has been long, winding, and fraught with\nobstacles, but it has also been filled with moments of awe, wonder, and insight, as we have delved\n12deeper into the mysteries of the fossil record, and uncovered secrets that have lain hidden for millions\nof years, secrets that have the power to transform our understanding of the world, and our place\nwithin it, rather like the revelation that the ancient Greeks believed the universe to be governed by\na set of eternal, unchanging laws, which, as it turns out, are reflected in the intricate, mathematical\npatterns that underlie the structure of the natural world, a world that is at once beautiful, complex,\nand mysterious, a world that continues to inspire, awe, and bewilder us, as we strive to understand its\nsecrets, and unlock the hidden treasures of the universe. As we stand at the threshold of this new frontier of knowledge, we are reminded of the wise words of\nthe great poet, William Blake,\n13",
        "Results and Findings": "The study of fossils is a complex and multifaceted field, one that requires a deep understanding\nof geology, biology, and ecology, as well as a strong background in mathematics and physics, a\ncombination of skills that is rare in the scientific community, and one that is essential for making new\ndiscoveries and advancing our understanding of the world of fossils, a world that is full of mysteries\nand wonders, and one that is waiting to be explored and understood, a task that will require the\ncombined efforts of scientists, philosophers, and poets, who must work together to unravel the secrets\nof the universe, and to reveal the hidden patterns and meanings that underlie the world of fossils,\na world that is both familiar and strange, a world that is full of contradictions and paradoxes, and\none that is waiting to be discovered and explored, a journey that will take us to the farthest reaches\nof the imagination, and one that will ultimately lead us to a deeper understanding of the world and\nour place within it, a world that is full of fossils, each one a reminder of the incredible history and\ndiversity of life on Earth, and each one a window into the mysteries of the universe, a universe that\nis full of wonders and surprises, and one that is waiting to be explored and understood, a task that\nwill require the combined efforts of scientists, philosophers, and poets, who must work together to\n2unravel the secrets of the universe, and to reveal the hidden patterns and meanings that underlie the\nworld of fossils, a world that is both familiar and strange, a world that is full of contradictions and\nparadoxes, and one that is waiting to be discovered and explored.

Furthermore, the analysis of fossilized tree trunks has revealed a correlation\nbetween the growth rings and the fluctuations in the global supply of chocolate, which in turn has\nbeen influenced by the mating habits of pandas. In a surprising turn of events, the field of fossil research has been revolutionized by the application\nof quantum mechanics and the discovery of a new subatomic particle that can only be detected by\nindividuals who have consumed a certain type of rare and exotic spice. The search for fossils has also been influenced by the development of new technologies, such as\nadvanced sonar and radar systems that can detect the presence of hidden fossils beneath the surface of\nthe earth, and sophisticated algorithms that can analyze the chemical composition of rocks and predict\nthe likelihood of finding fossils in a given area. Meanwhile, a parallel investigation into the aerodynamics of pterosaur flight led us down a rabbit\nhole of turbulence models and vortex dynamics, ultimately culminating in the development of a novel,\nfossil-based theory of wingtip vortices that defied the fundamental principles of aerodynamics, yet\nsomehow, inexplicably, worked in tandem with the resonant frequencies of crystal harmonics. Further-\nmore, an exhaustive analysis of the geochemical signatures within the fossil matrices revealed an\nuncanny correlation with the distribution of dark matter halos in the universe, which, in turn, seemed\nto be influencing the migratory patterns of certain species of iridescent, fossil-encrusted butterflies. A preliminary investigation into the application of neurolinguistic programming techniques to the\nanalysis of fossilized trackways revealed a surprising correspondence between the linguistic patterns\nembedded in the trackways and the distribution of prime numbers within the Fibonacci sequence,\nwhich, when extrapolated to the realm of quantum computing, yielded a novel, fossil-inspired\nalgorithm for factoring large composite numbers. The introduction of advanced, spectroscopic techniques to the study of fossilized plant residues\nenabled us to detect the presence of anomalous, non-terrestrial isotopes, whose origin and significance\nremained shrouded in mystery, yet seemed to be connected to an obscure, ancient text that spoke of a\nlong-lost civilization, whose technology had harnessed the power of quantum fluctuations to create a\nnetwork of stable, interdimensional portals, through which they had communed with the essence of\nfossilized, botanical entities. In a related, yet seemingly unrelated, vein of inquiry, we discovered that\nthe aerodynamic properties of fossilized, pterosaur wings were, in fact, a function of the underlying,\nfractal geometry of the wing\u2019s surface, which, when replicated in a controlled, laboratory setting,\nyielded a novel, biomimetic material with unprecedented, self-healing properties. The subsequent integration of these findings into our\nmethodological framework necessitated a radical, Expansion of our understanding of the fossil record,\n6as we came to realize that the history of life on Earth was, in fact, a mere, localized manifestation\nof a far more extensive, cosmic narrative, whose threads and patterns were, in turn, woven into the\nfabric of the universe itself. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of machine learning algorithms and other\nforms of artificial intelligence to analyze the fossil record, a development that has the potential to\nrevolutionize our understanding of the evolution of life on Earth, by providing a more detailed and\n8nuanced picture of the history of our planet and the emergence of complex life forms, a topic that\ncontinues to fascinate and inspire scientists and researchers, who, using a combination of fieldwork,\nlaboratory experiments, and computational simulations, are working to reconstruct the history of\nour planet and the evolution of life on Earth, a task that is made all the more challenging by the\nlimitations and uncertainties of the fossil record, which, despite its many limitations, remains one of\nthe most important and valuable tools for understanding the history of life on Earth, and which, when\nused in conjunction with other lines of evidence, including geological and geochemical data, can\nprovide a detailed and nuanced picture of the evolution of our planet and the emergence of complex\nlife forms, a topic that will continue to be the subject of intense scientific scrutiny and investigation\nin the years to come. Meanwhile, the results of our experiments on the effects of orange juice on the decomposition of\nfossils have yielded some fascinating insights, particularly with regards to the role of chimpanzees in\nthe dissemination of fungal spores that can break down the molecular structure of granite, which in\nturn has a profound impact on the flavor profile of artisanal cheeses. It has been observed that the\noptimal pH level for this process is precisely 7.32, which coincidentally is also the resonant frequency\nof the Himalayan singing bowls used in ancient Tibetan rituals to summon the great lizard king, who\nis rumored to possess the secrets of the universe and is known to indulge in excessive consumption of\ntartan-patterned socks. In a surprising twist, the analysis of our data has revealed a statistically significant correlation between\nthe number of fossilized mosquitoes and the average airspeed velocity of unladen swallows, which\nin turn is influenced by the aerodynamic properties of tutus worn by ballet dancers performing the\nchoreography of Swan Lake. Furthermore, our research has shown that the color palette of a typical fossil is comprised of a\nunique combination of chartreuse, puce, and burnt sienna, which are also the exact hues used in\nthe ceremonial robes of the ancient Egyptian goat herders, who were known to possess a deep\n9understanding of the intricacies of quantum mechanics and the art of making a perfect souffl\u00e9. The following table summarizes our findings on the relationship between fossilization and the\nconsumption of pineapple pizza:\nTable 2: Fossilization and Pineapple Pizza\nFossil Type Pineapple Pizza Consumption\nAmmonite 3.14 slices per day\nTrilobite 2.71 slices per hour\nDinosaur 1.62 slices per millennium\nIn another unexpected turn of events, our investigation into the acoustic properties of fossils has\nrevealed that they have the unique ability to amplify the sound of whispering librarians, which in turn\nhas been shown to have a profound impact on the growth patterns of Petunia hybrids, particularly\nwhen exposed to the radiation emitted by faulty microwave ovens. Additionally, our analysis of the crystal structure of fossils has shown that they possess a unique\nproperty that allows them to absorb and store the kinetic energy of rolling bowling balls, which in\nturn can be used to power a new generation of sustainable energy sources, such as the \"Fossil-Tron\n3000,\" a device that uses the vibrational frequencies of fossils to generate electricity and cook the\nperfect poached egg. This has led us to speculate that fossils may hold the key to solving the world\u2019s\nenergy crisis, particularly if we can harness the power of the \"Fossil-V ortex,\" a phenomenon wherein\nthe angular momentum of spinning fossils creates a whirlpool that can be used to propel ships across\nthe ocean at speeds of up to 300 knots. Moreover, our research has revealed that the fossilization process is closely tied to the art of Extreme\nIroning, wherein the intricate folds and creases of ironed fabrics are used to create a new form\nof fossilized fabric that can be used to make a new generation of high-tech clothing, such as the\n\"Fossil-Fleece,\" a material that is both waterproof and breathable, and has the unique property of\nchanging color in response to changes in the wearer\u2019s mood. This has led us to propose a new theory\nof fashion, wherein the style and cut of clothing are determined by the fossilized remains of ancient\ncivilizations, which in turn are influenced by the aerodynamic properties of winged unicorns. Furthermore, our analysis of the chemical composition of fossils has revealed that they possess a\nunique combination of elements, including the rare and exotic \"Fossilium,\" a substance that has been\nshown to have a profound impact on the human brain, particularly with regards to the development\nof creativity and imagination. It\nhas been discovered that the fossilized remains of ancient humans contain a unique genetic marker,\nwhich is also found in the DNA of modern humans, and which is thought to be responsible for\nthe development of language and cognitive abilities. This has led to a greater understanding of the\nevolution of the human species and the importance of fossils in the study of human history. For example, the incorporation of\nfossilized particles in pharmaceuticals has been shown to enhance their effectiveness and reduce their\nside effects, leading to the development of a new generation of \"Fossil-Based\" medicines. It has been discovered that the fossilized remains of ancient plants\ncontain a unique combination of elements, which are thought to be responsible for the development\nof photosynthesis and the ability of plants to convert sunlight into energy. It has been\ndiscovered that the fossilized remains of ancient animals contain a unique combination of elements,\nwhich are thought to be responsible for the development of the first animals and the origins of the\nanimal kingdom. This has led to a greater understanding of the evolution of animal life on Earth and\nthe importance of fossils in the study of animal history. It has been discovered that the fossilized\nremains of ancient plants and animals contain a unique combination of elements, which are thought\nto be responsible for the development of the Earth\u2019s climate and the origins of the first ecosystems. This has led to a greater understanding of the importance of fossils in the study of climate change and\nthe role of human activity in shaping the Earth\u2019s environment. 11Furthermore, our investigations have revealed a hitherto unknown correlation between the stratigraphic\ndistribution of fossilized tree ferns and the aerodynamic properties of supersonic aircraft, a discovery\nthat has far-reaching implications for the fields of paleobotany and aerospace engineering, not to\nmention the fledgling discipline of extremophile gastroenterology, which seeks to elucidate the\nmysteries of microbial life forms that thrive in environments hostile to human existence, such as the\nscorching hot springs of Yellowstone National Park, where, incidentally, one can find an abundance\nof thermophilic microorganisms that are capable of surviving in temperatures that would be lethal to\nmost known forms of life. Furthermore, our research has led us to a deeper understanding of the complex, interconnected web\nof relationships that exists between the natural world, and the human species, a web that is at once\nfragile, beautiful, and ephemeral, rather like the delicate, lace-like patterns of a spider\u2019s web, which,\nas it turns out, are a testament to the incredible ingenuity, and adaptability of the natural world, a\nworld that is capable of inspiring, and informing our own endeavors, as we strive to create a more\nsustainable, equitable, and just world, a world that is worthy of our highest aspirations, and our\ndeepest desires, a world that is at once a reflection of our greatest hopes, and our darkest fears, a\nworld that continues to evolve, and unfold, like a great, cosmic tapestry, woven from the threads of\nspace, and time.",
        "Conclusion": "1 Introduction\nThe perpetuation of frivolous notions regarding the existential implications of florid antagonisms in\nthe grande bouffe of paleontological discoveries has led to a plethora of misconceptions about the\nfundamental nature of fossils, which, incidentally, have been found to have a profound impact on the\nsocio-economic dynamics of rural areas in Slovenia, where the average citizen spends approximately\n37.5 hours per week contemplating the nuances of postmodern furniture design, a phenomenon\nthat has been linked to the increased consumption of tartar sauce in the region, a condiment that,\nparadoxically, has been shown to have a direct correlation with the aerodynamic properties of\nfossilized insect wings, whose intricate patterns have inspired a new generation of pastry chefs in the\nPhilippines, where the art of creating elaborate desserts has become an integral part of the national\nidentity, much like the revered tradition of playing the harmonica with one\u2019s feet, a skill that requires\nimmense dexterity and coordination, not unlike the complex processes involved in the formation\nof fossils, which, as we know, are the result of a series of cataclysmic events that have shaped the\nEarth\u2019s surface over millions of years, including the Great Sock Rebellion of 1987, a pivotal moment\nin history that marked the beginning of the end of the sock industry as we knew it, and which, in\nturn, had a profound impact on the development of modern sock puppetry, a art form that has been\nemployed by scientists to study the behavioral patterns of fossilized creatures, such as the Megalodon,\na prehistoric shark whose fossilized teeth have been found to possess mystical properties, allowing\nthem to ward off evil spirits and attract positive energies, a phenomenon that has been exploited\nby New Age practitioners, who use these fossils in their rituals to connect with the cosmic forces\nthat govern the universe, a realm that is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics, which,\nas we know, are responsible for the bizarre occurrences that take place in the realm of subatomic\nparticles, where the laws of physics are constantly being challenged and subverted, much like the\nway in which the discovery of fossils challenges our understanding of the natural world, forcing us to\nreevaluate our assumptions and rethink our theories, a process that is akin to navigating a labyrinthine\nmaze of mirrors, where reflections of reality are distorted and fragmented, and where the search\nfor truth becomes a Sisyphean task, a never-ending quest that is fraught with peril and uncertainty,\nyet, paradoxically, it is in these moments of uncertainty that we find the greatest opportunities for\ngrowth and discovery, much like the way in which the process of fossilization itself is a metaphorfor the human condition, a reminder that our existence is but a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry\nof time, a moment that is both ephemeral and eternal, a paradox that lies at the heart of the human\nexperience, and one that is reflected in the intricate patterns and shapes that are found in fossils,\nwhich, as we know, are the result of a complex interplay of geological and biological processes,\nincluding the actions of microorganisms, such as bacteria and archaea, which play a crucial role in\nthe decomposition and transformation of organic matter, a process that is essential for the formation\nof fossils, and which, incidentally, has been linked to the development of new technologies for the\nproduction of biofuels, a field that holds great promise for the future of energy production, and one\nthat is closely tied to the study of fossils, which, as we know, are a window into the past, a record of\nthe history of life on Earth, and a reminder of the incredible diversity and complexity of the natural\nworld, a world that is full of mysteries and wonders, and one that is waiting to be

patterns and meanings\nthat underlie the world of fossils, a world that is both familiar and strange, a world that is full of\ncontradictions and paradoxes, and one that is waiting to be discovered and explored, a journey that\nwill take us to the farthest reaches of the imagination, and one that will challenge our assumptions\nand push the boundaries of our understanding, a journey that is both exhilarating and terrifying, and\none that will ultimately lead us to a deeper understanding of the world and our place within it, a world\nthat is full of fossils, each one a reminder of the

not dissimilar to the way in which the human brain processes the complexities\nof quantum mechanics, particularly in relation to the fluctuational dynamics of subatomic particles,\nwhich, incidentally, have been found to exhibit a curious affinity for the works of 19th-century French\nnovelist, Gustave Flaubert, whose writings on the human condition continue to influence contemporary\nthought, including the development of new methodologies for analyzing the aerodynamic properties\nof fossilized insect wings, a field of study that has seen significant advances in recent years, thanks\nin part to the pioneering work of researchers who have successfully applied the principles of chaos\ntheory to the study of Ancient Egyptian dental hygiene, a topic that, at first glance, may seem\nunrelated to the study of fossils, but, upon closer inspection, reveals a fascinating array of connections\nand synergies, including the use of nanotechnology to create ultra-durable toothbrushes, which,\nwhen used in conjunction with a specialized brand of toothpaste, have been shown to be remarkably\neffective in removing plaque and tartar from the teeth of fossilized hominids, thereby providing\nvaluable insights into the dietary habits and lifestyles of our ancient ancestors, who, as it turns out,\nwere quite fond of consuming large quantities of fermented foods, including a type of primitive\nsauerkraut that was made from the fermented leaves of a now-extinct species of plant, the remnants of\nwhich can still be found in the form of fossilized impresssions, which, when analyzed using advanced\nspectrographic techniques, reveal a complex array of organic compounds that are eerily similar to\nthose found in the ink of the cuttlefish, a cephalopod that has been the subject of intense scientific\nscrutiny in recent years, due in part to its remarkable ability to change color and texture, a process that\nis made possible by the presence of specialized cells called chromatophores, which, when stimulated\nby electrical impulses, can expand or contract to produce a wide range of colors and patterns, a\nphenomenon that has been observed and documented in great detail by researchers who have spent\ncountless hours studying the behavior of these fascinating creatures, often under the most challenging\nand unpredictable conditions, including the recent experiment in which a team of scientists attempted\n7to train a group of cuttlefish to play a simplified version of the board game, Scrabble, using a custom-\ndesigned interface that allowed the animals to select letters and form words, a task that proved to be\nfar more difficult than expected, due in part to the cuttlefish\u2019s tendency to become distracted by the\npresence of shiny objects, including the reflective surface of a nearby mirror, which, when placed\nin the vicinity of the experimental apparatus, caused the animals to become completely absorbed\nin their own reflections, leading to a series of unexpected and fascinating observations, including\nthe discovery that cuttlefish are capable of recognizing and mimicking human facial expressions, a\nfinding that has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of intelligence and\ncognition in the animal kingdom, and which, when considered in the context of the fossil record,\nsuggests that the emergence of complex life forms on Earth may have been influenced by a variety of\nfactors, including the presence of certain types of minerals and nutrients in the primordial oceans,\nwhich, when combined with the energy from sunlight and the chemical reactions that occurred on\nthe early Earth, gave rise to the first self-replicating molecules, a process that, over time, led to the\ndevelopment of increasingly complex organisms, including the earliest forms of life that are preserved\nin the fossil record, which, when studied and analyzed using advanced techniques and methodologies,\nprovide a unique window into the history of our planet and the evolution of life on Earth, a topic that\ncontinues to fascinate and inspire scientists and

topic that has been the subject of much speculation and debate, and which,\nwhen considered in the context of the fossil record, suggests that the emergence of complex life forms\non Earth may have been influenced by a variety of factors, including the presence of certain types of\nminerals and nutrients in the primordial oceans, which, when combined with the energy from sunlight\nand the chemical reactions that occurred on the early Earth, gave rise to the first self-replicating\nmolecules, a process that, over time, led to the development of increasingly complex organisms,\nincluding the earliest forms of life that are preserved in the fossil record, which, when studied and\nanalyzed using advanced techniques and methodologies, provide a unique window into the history of\nour

In conclusion, our research has shown that fossils are not just ancient relics of a bygone era, but are\nin fact a key to unlocking the secrets of the universe, particularly with regards to the mysteries of\nthe space-time continuum and the art of making a perfect croissant. In another area of research,\n6 Conclusion\nThe culmination of our research endeavors has led us to a precipice of profound insight, wherein the\nostensibly disparate realms of fossilogy and culinary arts converge in a maelstrom of unanticipated\ndiscoveries.

But when I have finished, if the solution is\nnot beautiful, I know it is wrong,\" a statement that encapsulates the essence of our research, which has\nbeen driven by a passion for discovery, a thirst for knowledge, and a deep, abiding sense of wonder at\nthe mysteries of the universe, which, as it turns out, are reflected in the intricate, swirling patterns of\na fossilized ammonite shell, a testament to the beauty, complexity, and mystery of the natural world. In the end, our research has led us to a profound realization, a realization that the natural world, and\nthe human species are intimately connected, and that our fate is inextricably linked to the fate of the\nplanet, a realization that is at once beautiful, terrifying, and sublime, rather like the great, cosmic\ndance of creation, and destruction, that has been unfolding since the dawn of time, a dance that is\nat once a testament to the incredible beauty, and complexity of the universe, and a reminder of the\nfragility, and impermanence of all things, a reminder that our time on this planet is short, and that we\nmust strive to make the most of it, to live our lives to the fullest, to cherish every moment, and to\nnever forget the incredible beauty, and wonder of the world around us."

        "Abstract": "Subspace Constraint Method of Feature Tracking\nAbstract\nFeature tracking in video is a crucial task in computer vision. Our approach does not require direct modeling\nof the structure or the motion of the scene, and runs in real time on a single CPU\ncore. Empirical dimension is governed by its parameter, \u03f5. An\u03f5near 0 results in a \u201cstrict\u201d estimator, which\nis appropriate for estimating dimension in situations where you have little noise and you expect your\ndata to live in true linear spaces. 3.3.1 Minimization Strategy\nThe total energy function we propose for constrained tracking is non-convex since the contributions\nfrom the template fit terms are not convex (even if P is convex); this is also the case with other feature\ntracking methods, including the Lucas-Kanade tracker. This is not a technical\nlimitation of one particular tracking implementation.",
        "Methodology": "While this approach\nworks quite well when dealing with high- quality video and \u201cstrong\u201d features, it\noften falters when faced with dark and noisy video containing low-quality features. We present a framework for jointly tracking a set of features, which enables sharing\ninformation between the different features in the scene. The celebrated Kanade-Lucas-\nTomasi algorithm tracks feature points by searching for matches between templates representing\neach feature and a frame of video. Despite many other alternatives and improvement, it is still one\nof the best video feature tracking algorithms. In this work we will combine the low-rank geometry of the\ncohort of tracked features with the successful non-linear single feature tracking framework of Lucas\nand Kanade by adding a low-rank regularization penalty in the tracking optimization problem. To\naccommodate dynamic scenes with non-trivial motion we apply our rank constraint over a sliding\nwindow, so that we only consider a small number of frames at a given time (this is a common idea\nfor dealing with non-rigid motions). 2 On Low-Rank Feature Trajectories\nUnder the affine camera model, the feature trajectories for a set of features from a rigid body should\nexist in an affine subspace of dimension 3, or a linear subspace of dimension 4. However, subspaces\n.corresponding to very degenerate motion are lower-dimensional those corresponding to general\nmotion. we consider a sliding temporal window, where over\nshort durations the motion is simple and the feature trajectories are of lower rank. The restriction\non the length of feature trajectories can also help in satisfying an approximate local affine camera\nmodel in scenes which violate the affine camera model. If z1does not have integer\ncoordinates, T is interpolated from the image. We denote \u2126= 1, ..., n \u00d71, ..., n and we parametrize T\nso that its pixel values are obtained by T(u)u\u2208\u2126. To apply continuous optimization we view x1as a\ncontinuous variable and we thus view T and I as functions over continuous domains (implemented\nwith bi-linear interpolation). 3.1 Low Rank Regularization Framework\nIf we want to encourage a low rank structure in the trajectories, we cannot view the tracking of\ndifferent features as separate problems. For f \u22081, 2, ..., F, let xfdenote the position of feature f in\nthe current frame (in image coordinates), and let x = ( x1,x2, ...,xF)\u2208R2Fdenote the joint state of\nall features in the scene. We define the total energy function as follows:\nC(x) =1\nFn2FX\nf=1X\nu\u2208\u2126\u03c8(Tf(u)\u2212I(u+xf))\nwhere Tf(u) is the template for feature f. Now, we can impose desired relationships between features\nin a scene by imposing constraints on the domain of optimization. Instead of enforcing a hard constraint, we add a penalty term to, which increases the cost of states\nwhich are inconsistent with low-rank motion. Specifically, we define:\nC(x) =\u03b1FX\nf=1X\nu\u2208\u2126\u03c8(Tf(u)\u2212I(u+xf)) +P(x)\nwhere P(x) is an estimate of, or proxy for, the dimensionality of the set of feature trajectories over the\nlast several frames of video (past feature locations are treated as constants, so this is a function only\nof the current state, x). Notice that we have replaced the scale factor 1/( Fn2) from with the constant\n\u03b1, as this coefficient is now also responsible for controlling the relative strength of the penalty term. This framework gives rise to two different solutions, characterized by the strength of the penalty\nterm (definition of \u03b1). In the first case, we assume\n2that most (but not necessarily all) features in the scene approximately obey a low rank model. We can impose a weak\nconstraint by making the penalty term small relative to the other terms. If a feature is strong, it will\nconfidently track the imagery, ignoring the constraint (regardless of whether the motion is consistent\nwith the other features in the scene). In the second case, we assume that all features in the scene are supposed to agree with a low rank\nmodel (and deviations from that model are indicative of tracking errors). We can impose a strong\nconstraint by making the penalty term large relative to the other terms. No small set of features can\noverpower the constraint, regardless of how strong the features are. This forces all features to move is\na way that is consistent with a simple motion. Thus, a small number of features can even be occluded,\nand their positions will be predicted by the motion of the other features in the scene. 3.2 Specific Choices of the Low-Rank Regularizer\nThere is now a large body of work on low rank regularization. Each choice we present defines P(x) in terms\nof a matrix M. It is the 2(L + 1) \u00d7F matrix whose column f contains the feature trajectory for\nfeature f within a sliding window of L + 1 consecutive frames (current frame and L past frames). One may alternatively center the\ncolumns of M by subtracting from each column the average of all columns. Most constraints derived\nfor trajectories actually confine trajectories to a low rank affine subspace (as opposed to a linear\nsubspace). Centering the columns of M transforms an affine constraint into a linear one. Alternatively,\none can forgo centering and view an affine constraint as a linear constraint in one dimension higher. However, an explicit factorization can be used in a penalty term by measuring the deviation of M, in\nsome norm, from its approximate low rank factorization. For example, if we let\nM=U\u03a3VT\ndenote the SVD of M, we can take P(x) to be ||BC M||, where B is the first three or four columns of U,\nand C is the first three or four rows of VT. Then this P corresponds to penalizing M viaPF\ni=d+1\u03c3i,\nwhere \u03c3i=\u03bbiiis the ithsingular value of M. As above, since the history is fixed, U, \u03a3, and VTare\nfunctions of x. This approach assumes knowledge of the low-rank d. For simplicity, we assume a local rigid model\nand thus set d = 3 when centering M and d = 4 when not centering. .\u03c32(L+1)\u2227F)Tis the vector of singular\nvalues of M, and || \u00b7||1is the l1norm. Unlike explicit factorization, where only energy outside the first\nd principal components of M is punished, the nuclear norm will favor lower-rank M over higher-rank\nM even when both matrices have rank d. Thus, using this kind of penalty will favor simpler track\npoint motions over more complex ones, even when both are technically permissible. First, empirical dimension is invariant\nunder rotation and scaling of a data set. Thus, d\u03f5is a true dimension estimator (whereas\nthe nuclear norm is a proxy for dimension). If \u03f5is near 1 then d\u03f5is a lenient estimator. This makes it less\nsensitive to noise, and more tolerant of data sets that are only approximately linear. We use this form for so that all terms in the total\nenergy function behave linearly in a known range of values. If our fit terms behaved quadratically,\nit would be more challenging to balance them against a penalty term. We fix a parameter m for each penalty form (selected empirically - see the supplementary material\nfor our procedure), which determines the strength of the penalty. The weak and strong regularization\nparameters are set as follows:\n\u03b1weak =1\nmn2and\u03b1strong =1\nmFn2\nThe weak scaling implies that a perfectly-matched feature will contribute 0 to the total energy, and a\npoorly-matched feature will contribute an amount on the order of 1/m to the total energy. Since we do not divide the contributions of\neach feature by the number of features, the penalty terms contribution is comparable in magnitude to\nthat of a single feature. The strong scaling implies that the penalty term is on the same scale as the\nsum of the contributions of all of the features in the scene. We employ a 1st-order descent approach for\ndriving the energy to a local minimum. To reduce the computational load of feature tracking, some trackers use 2nd-order methods for\noptimization. This works well when tracking strong features, but in our experience it can be\nunreliable when dealing with weak or ambiguous features. Since we are explicitly trying to improve\ntracking accuracy on poor features we opt for a 1st-order descent approach instead. If we pursue standard gradient descent, the strong\nfeatures dictate the step direction and the weak features have very little effect on it. Ideally, once the\nstrong features are correctly positioned, they will no longer dominate the step direction. If we were\nable to perfectly measure the gradient of our objective function, this would be the case. In practice,\nthe error in our numerical gradient estimate can be large enough to prevent the strong features from\n4ever relinquishing control over the step direction. The result is that in a scene with both very strong\nand very weak features, the weak features may not be tracked. To remedy this, we compute our step direction by blending the gradient of the energy function with a\nvector that corresponds to taking equal-sized gradient descent steps separately for each feature. We\nuse a fast line search in each iteration to find the nearest local minimum in the step direction. This\ncompromise approach allows for efficient descent while ensuring that each feature has some control\nover the step direction (regardless of feature strength). Because the energy is not convex, it is important to choose a good initial state. We use a combination\nof two strategies to initialize the tracking: first, we generate our initial guess of x by registering an\nentire frame of video with the previous (at lower resolution). Secondly, we use multi-resolution, or\npyramidal tracking so that approximate motion on a large scale can help us get close to the minimum\nbefore we try tracking on finer resolution levels. Let I denote a full new frame of video and let xprev be\nthe concatenation of feature positions in the previous frame. We form a pyramid for I where level 0\nis the full-resolution image and each higher level m (1 through 3) has half the vertical and half the\nhorizontal resolution of level m 1. To initialize the optimization, we take the full frame (at resolution\nlevel 3) and register it against the previous frame (also at resolution level 3) using gradient descent\nand an absolute value loss function. We initialize each features position in the current frame by taking\nits position in the previous frame and adding the offset between the frames, as found through this\nregistration process). Once we have our initial x, we begin optimization on the top pyramid level. On any given pyramid level, we perform\noptimization by iteratively computing a step direction and conducting a fast line search to find a local\nminimum in the search direction. We impose a minimum and maximum on the number of steps to be\nperformed on each level ( min iandmax i, respectively). To compute our search direction in each step, we first compute the gradient of C (which we will\ncallDC) and set a =\nThis is done by breaking it into a collection of 2-vectors (elements 1 and 2 are together, elements\n3 and 4 are together, and so on) and normalizing each of them. We then recombine the normalized\n2-vectors to get b. We blend a with c to compute our step direction. 3.3.2 Efficiency and Complexity\nWe have found that our algorithm typically converges in about 20 iterations or less at each pyramid\nlevel (with fewer iterations on lower pyramid levels). Thus, on average, less than 80 iterations are required to track from\none frame to the next. Our C++ implementation (which makes use of OpenCV) can run\non 35 features of size 7-by-7 with a temporal window of 6 frames (L = 5) on a 3rd-generation\nIntel i5 CPU at approximately 16 frames per second. SIMD instructions are used in places, but no\nmulti-threading was used, so faster processing rates are possible. 4 Experiments\nTo evaluate our method, we conducted tests on several real video sequences in circumstances that are\ndifficult for feature tracking. The resulting\nvideos contained dark regions with few good features and the unsteady camera motion and poor\nlighting introduced time-varying motion blur. In these video sequences it proved very difficult to hand-register features for ground-truth. In order to\npresent a quantitative numerical comparison we also collected higher-quality video sequences and\nsynthetically degraded their quality. We used a standard Lucas-Kanade tracker on the non-degraded\n5videos to generate ground-truth (the output was human-verified and corrected). When following a non-distinctive feature, the single-feature energy\nfunction often flattens out in one or more directions. This results in the tracked\nlocation drifting away from a features true location (i.e. This claim can be verified by attempting\n6",
        "Results and Findings": "We show that our method\ncan be employed to track features for both rigid and non- rigid motions (possibly\nof few moving bodies) even when some features are occluded. Furthermore, it can\nbe used to significantly improve tracking results in poorly-lit scenes (where there\nis a mix of good and bad features). We demonstrate very strong performance in rigid environments\nas well as in scenes with multiple and/or non- rigid motion (since the trajectories of all features are\nstill low rank for short time intervals). We describe experiments with several choices of low-rank\nregularizers (which are local in time), using a unified optimization framework that allows real time\nregularized tracking on a single CPU core. That is, we minimize the single-feature energy\nfunction c( x1):\nc(x1) =1\n2X\nu\u2208\u2126\u03c8(T(u)\u2212I(u+x1))\nwhere, for example, \u03c8(x) = |x| or \u03c8(x) = x2. We report results for both approaches. . To use empirical dimension as our regularizer, we define\nP(x) = d\u03f5(M). When done on the top level, we use the result to initialize optimization on the level below it, and\nso on until we have found a local minimum on level 0. In our experiments, we used a resolution\nof 640-by-480 (we have also done tests at 1000 \u00d7562), and we found that 4 pyramid levels were\nsufficient for reliable tracking. We therefore present\nqualitative results on real, low-quality video sequences, as well as quantitative results on a set of\nsynthetically degraded videos. 4.1 Qualitative Experiments on Real Videos\nIn our tests on real video sequences containing low- quality features, single-feature tracking does\nnot provide acceptable results.",
        "Conclusion": "At last, even in the case of multiple moving rigid objects, the set of trajectories is still low rank\n(confined to the union of a few low rank subspaces). We also tested a Huber loss\nfunction for and have concluded that such a regularization is not needed. We now explain the details of the algorithm. Algorithm 1 summarizes the full\nprocess."

        "Abstract": "Analyzing Groups of Neurons in Neural Networks: Comparing\nInformation from Input and Output Perspectives\nAbstract\nThe concept of a \"modular\" structure in artificial neural networks has been suggested as beneficial for learning,\nthe ability to combine elements, and applying knowledge to new situations. This has significant implications for representation learning, as it implies that\nfinding modular representations that reflect input structure (e.g., disentanglement) may be a different objective\nfrom learning modular representations that reflect output structure (e.g., compositionality). If an entire column of P is zero, that cluster is unused, so c only provides an upper-limit to the number of clusters, and in\npractice we set c = n. Girvan Newman propose the following score to quantify the level of \"modularity\" when partitioning the\nnormalized adjacency matrix \u02dcAinto the cluster assignments P:\nQ(\u02dcA, P) =Tr(PT\u02dcAP)\u2212Tr(PT\u02dcA1n1T\nn\u02dcAP) (8)\nThe first term sums the total connectivity (or, in our case, similarity) of units that share a cluster. We define the modularity of a set of neural network units as the maximum achievable Q over all P:\nP\u2217(\u02dcA) =argmax PQ(\u02dcA, P)Q\u2217(\u02dcA) =Q(\u02dcA, P\u2217) (9)\nTo summarize, to divide a given pairwise similarity matrix S into modules, we first construct \u02dcAfrom S, then we find the cluster\nassignments P\u2217that give the maximal value Q\u2217. All cluster-similarity methods we investigated gave qualitatively similar results, so here we report only the \"Element\nSimilarity\" method of Gates et al., which is a value between 0 and 1 that is small when two cluster assignments are unrelated, and\nlarge when one cluster assignment is highly predictive of the other.

        "Methodology": "However, a clear definition and\nmeasurement of modularity are still open questions. This paper reframes the identification of functional modules as\nthe identification of groups of units with similar functions. To address this, we examine two main categories of methods: those that define\nsimilarity based on how units react to variations in inputs (upstream), and those that define similarity based on\nhow changes in hidden unit activations affect outputs (downstream). For each model, we assess the relationships between pairs of hidden units in each layer using a range\nof upstream and downstream metrics, then group them by maximizing their \"modularity score\" with established\nnetwork science tools. Second, while we observe general agreement on clusters\nwithin upstream methods and within downstream methods, there is limited agreement on cluster assignments\nbetween these two categories. This design approach offers benefits like enhanced robustness and quicker adaptation to new\nchallenges. It is recognized that learning systems gain advantages from structures tailored to the specific problem, and many\nreal-world problems can indeed be divided into sub-problems. Consequently, modularity is viewed as a standard design principle in\nevolved biological systems, including biological neural networks, and one that can be advantageous for artificial neural networks\n(ANNs). Despite the intuitive appeal, formally defining and quantifying the modularity of a given system remains an unresolved issue. It is\ngenerally agreed that modular systems, by definition, break down into subsystems that carry out functions to solve sub-problems. Defining modules in ANNs, therefore, requires us to determine when two parts of a network are involved in the same \"function\". In\nthis paper, we address this question at the level of pairs of hidden units. We explore various methods for assessing the \"functional\nsimilarity\" of any two hidden units, and we define a \"module\" as a group of units with similar functions. This definition is not\nintended to be the definitive answer to what constitutes a module, but rather to offer a practical foundation for experimenting with\ndifferent concepts related to modularity, such as how regularization affects it. In Section 3, we provide precise definitions and detail our method for identifying and\nquantifying functional modules in the hidden layers of trained neural networks by grouping units into functionally similar sets. Besides quantitatively evaluating modularity, we further examine whether different similarity measures agree on the assignment of\nunits to modules. Surprisingly, we find that modules identified using \"upstream\" measures of functional similarity are consistently\ndifferent from those found using \"downstream\" measures. Each pathway can be viewed as a\nspecialized module (and can be further divided into submodules). Numerous prior experiments on modularity in artificial neural\nnetworks have investigated principles that would lead to similarly distinct what/where information processing in ANNs. A significant\ndistinction from this line of work is that, instead of predefining the functional role of modules, such as one module handling \"what\"\nand another handling \"where,\" our research aims to discover distinct functional groups in trained networks. Generally, there are two categories of approaches to modularity in neural networks, each corresponding to a different way of\nunderstanding the function of network components. The structural modularity approach defines function based on network weights\nand the connections between sub-networks. Modules are thus defined as sub-networks with dense internal connections and sparse\nexternal connections. The functional modularity approach focuses on network activations or the information represented by those\nactivations, rather than weights. This includes concepts like disentanglement, compositionality, and invariance. While they seem to be (or should be) correlated, it has been observed\nthat even very sparse inter-module connectivity does not always ensure functional separation of information processing. In this study,\nwe adopt the functional approach, assuming that structural modularity is only useful to the extent that it supports distinct functions\nof the units, and that often distinct functions must share information, making strict structural boundaries potentially detrimental. Our work is most closely related to a series of papers by Watanabe and colleagues in which trained networks are decomposed into\nclusters of \"similar\" units with the aim of understanding and simplifying those networks. They quantify the similarity of units using\na combination of both incoming and outgoing weights. 3 Quantifying modularity by clustering similarity\nWe divide the task of identifying functional modules into two phases: evaluating the pairwise similarity of units, and then clustering\nbased on this similarity. For simplicity, we apply these steps separately to each hidden layer, although in principle, modules could be\nassessed in the same way after combining layers. Section 3.1 defines the set of pairwise functional similarity methods we use, and\nSection 3.2 describes the clustering phase. While we concentrate on similarity between pairs of individual units, our method is connected to, and inspired by, the question of\nwhat makes neural representations \"similar\" when comparing entire populations of neurons to each other. In preliminary\nwork, we explored such a definition of functional modules, using representational (dis)similarity between sub-populations of neurons. The primary challenge with this approach is that existing representational similarity methods are highly sensitive to dimensionality\n(the number of neurons in each cluster), and it is not clear how best to account for this when calculating dissimilarity between clusters\nso that the method is not biased towards larger or smaller cluster sizes. To further justify our method, note that representational\nsimilarity analysis is closely related to tests for statistical (in)dependence between populations of neurons, and so the problem of\nfinding mutually \"dissimilar\" modules is analogous to the problem of finding independent subspaces. However, Palmer Makeig showed\nthat a solution to the problem of detecting independent subspaces is to simply cluster the individual dimensions of the space. This\nprovides some justification for the methods we use here: some technicalities notwithstanding, the problem of finding subspaces of\nneural activity with \"dissimilar\" representations is, in many cases, reducible to the problem of clustering individual units based on\npairwise similarity, as we do here. 3.1 Quantifying pairwise similarity of hidden units\nWhat constitutes \"functional similarity\" between two hidden units? In other words, we are looking for a similarity function S that\ntakes a neural network N, a dataset D, and a task T as inputs, and produces an n x n matrix of non-negative similarity scores for all\npairs among the n hidden units. We also require that the resulting matrix is symmetric, meaning Sij = Sji. Similarity by covariance. The first similarity measure we examine is the absolute value of the covariance of hidden unit activities\nacross inputs. Let xk be the kth input in the dataset, and hi(x) be the response of the ith hidden unit to input x, with i in 1, 2, ..., n.\nThen, we define similarity as\nScov\nij=1\nKKX\nk=1|(hi(xk)\u2212\u00afhi)(hj(xk)\u2212\u00afhj)| (1)\n2where K is the number of items in D and \u00afhiis the mean response of unit i on the given dataset. Similarity by input sensitivity. Then, we say two units i and j are similarly sensitive to input changes on\ninput xkif the dot product between the ith and jth row of Jh\nxkhas high absolute-value magnitude. Similarity by last-layer sensitivity. Let y denote the last-layer activity of the network. Using the same Jacobian notation as above, let\nJy\nhdenote the o x n matrix of partial derivatives of the last layer with respect to changes in the hidden activities h. Then, we define\nsimilarity by output sensitivity as\nSo\u2212sens\nij =1\nKKX\nk=1|Jy\nh(Jy\nh)T| (3)\nlikewise with \"o-sens\" to be read as \"output-sensitivity.\" Note that both h and y depend on the particular input xk, but this has been\nleft implicit in the notation to reduce clutter. To quote Lipson, \"In order to measure modularity, one must have a quantitative definition of function... It is\nthen possible to take an arbitrary chunk of a system and measure the dependency of the system function on elements within that\nchunk. The more that the dependency itself depends on elements outside the chunk, the less the function of that chunk is localized,\nand hence the less modular it is.\" Lipson then goes on to suggest that the \"dependence of system function on elements\" can be expressed as a derivative or gradient,\nand that the dependence of that dependence on other parts of the system can be expressed as the second derivative or Hessian. Towards this conception of modular functions on a particular task, we use the following definition of similarity:\nShess\nij=1\nKKX\nk=1|\u22022L\n\u2202hi\u2202hj| (4)\nwhere L is the scalar loss function for the task, and should be understood to depend on the particular input xk. Importantly, each\nHessian on the right hand side is taken with respect to the activity of hidden units, not with respect to the network parameters as it is\ntypically defined. To summarize, equations (1) through (4) provide four different methods to quantify pairwise similarity of hidden units. Scovand\nSi\u2212sensare upstream, while So\u2212sensandShessare downstream. All four take values in [0, ). However, it is not clear if the raw\nmagnitudes matter, or only relative (normalized) magnitudes. For these reasons, we introduce an optional normalized version of\neach of the above four un-normalized similarity measures:\nS\u2032\nij=Sij\nmax(Sii, Sjj, \u03f5)(5)\nwhere \u02d820ac is a small positive value included for numerical stability. Whereas Sijis in [0, ), the normalized values are restricted\ntoS\u2032\nijin [0,1]. In total, this gives us eight methods to quantify pairwise similarity. These can be thought of as 2x2x2 product of\nmethods, as shown in the color scheme in Figure 2: the upstream vs downstream axis, the unnormalized vs normalized axis, and\nthe covariance vs gradient (i.e. We group together both ScovandShessunder the term \"covariance\" because the\nHessian is closely related to the covariance of gradient vectors of the loss across inputs. In particular, Girvan Newman proposed a method that cuts a graph into its maximally\nmodular subgraphs, and this tool has previously been used to study modular neural networks. 3We apply this tool from graph theory to our problem of detecting functional modules in neural networks by constructing an adjacency\nmatrix A from the similarity matrix S by simply removing the diagonal (self-similarity):\nAij=\u001aSijif i\u0338=j\n0 otherwise(6)\nGiven A, we can simplify later notation by first constructing the normalized adjacency matrix, \u02dcA, whose elements all sum to one:\n\u02dcAij=AijP\nijAij(7)\nor, more compactly, \u02dcA=A/1T\nnA1nwhere 1nis a column vector of length n containing all ones. Let P be an n x c matrix that\nrepresents cluster assignments for each of n units to a maximum of c different clusters. Cluster assignments can be \"hard\" ( Pijin 0,\n1) or \"soft\" ( Pijin [0, 1]), but in either case the constraint P1c= 1nmust be met, i.e. that the sum of cluster assignments for each\nunit is 1. By itself, this term is maximized\nwhen P assigns all units to a single cluster. This second term encourages P to place units into the same cluster only if they are\nmore similar to each other than \"chance.\" Together, equation (8) is maximized by partitioning \u02dcAinto clusters that are strongly\nintra-connected and weakly inter-connected. Importantly, this optimization process provides two pieces of information: a\nmodularity score Q\u2217which quantifies the amount of modularity in a set of neurons, for a given similarity measure. We also get\nthe actual cluster assignments P\u2217, which provide additional information and can be compared across different similarity measures. Given a set of cluster assignments P\u2217, we quantify the number of clusters by first getting the fraction of units in each cluster,\nr(P\u2217) = 1T\nnP\u2217/n. We then use the formula for discrete entropy to measure the dispersion of cluster sizes: H(r) =\u2212Pc\ni=1rilogri. Finding P\u2217exactly is NP-complete, so in practice we use a variation on the approximate method proposed by Newman. Briefly, the\napproximation works in two steps: first, an initial set of cluster assignments is constructed using a fast spectral initialization method\nthat, similar to other spectral clustering algorithms, recursively divides units into clusters based on the sign of eigenvectors of the\n4matrix B=\u02dcA\u2212\u02dcA1n1T\nn\u02dcAand its submatrices. Only subdivisions that increase Q are kept. In the second step, we use a Monte Carlo\nmethod that repeatedly selects a random unit i then resamples its cluster assignment, holding the other n-1 assignments fixed. This\nresampling step involves a kind of exploration/exploitation trade-off: Q may decrease slightly on each move to potentially find a\nbetter global optimum. Supplemental Figure S2 shows that both the initialization and the Monte\nCarlo steps play a crucial role in finding P\u2217, consistent with the observations of Newman. based on the eight different\nmethods for quantifying pairwise similarity introduced in the previous section, we opted to study a large collection of simple networks\ntrained on MNIST. All pairwise similarity scores were computed using held-out test data. We trained 270 models, comprising 9 runs\nof each of 30 regularization settings, summarized in Table 1. We defined x (input layer) as the raw 784-dimensional pixel inputs and\ny (output layer) as the 10-dimensional class logits. We used the same basic feedforward architecture for all models, comprising\ntwo layers of hidden activity connected by three layers of fully-connected weights: Linear(784, 64), ReLU, dropout(p), Linear(64,\n64), ReLU, dropout(p), Linear(64, 10). Dropout would decrease modularity by encouraging functions to be \"spread out\" over many units. L2 regularization (weight\ndecay) would minimally impact modularity since the L2 norm is invariant to rotation while modularity depends on axis-alignment. L1 regularization on weights would increase modularity by encouraging sparsity between subnetworks. All similarity measures\nwould be qualitatively consistent with each other. As shown below, all four of these hypotheses turned out to be wrong, to varying degrees. In this example, it also appears that the number and size of clusters remains roughly constant; this observation is confirmed by\nplotting the number of clusters versus regularization strength in Supplemental Figure S4. Figure 3 shows a number of surprising patterns that contradict our initial predictions. This is especially apparent in the upstream methods (first two columns of the figure), and is also stronger for the first hidden\nlayer than the second (Supplemental Figure S3). In other words, hidden units become more clusterable because they are driven towards\nbehaving like functional replicas of each other, separately for each cluster. The next section explores the question of similarity in the results in more detail. Note that this cluster-similarity analysis is applied only to P\u2217\ncluster assignments computed in the same layer of the same model. This analysis also reveals secondary structure within each class of upstream and downstream\nmethods, where the choice to normalize not (S vs \u02dcS) appears to matter little, and where there is a moderate difference between\nmoment-based methods ( Scov,Shess) and gradient-based methods ( Si\u2212sens,So\u2212sens). It is worth noting that some of this secondary\nstructure is not robust across all types and levels of regularization; in particular, increasing L2 or L1 regularization strength appears\nto lead to (i) stronger dependence on normalization in the downstream methods, and (ii) a stronger overall agreement among the\nupstream methods (Supplemental Figure S5). As shown in Figure 4b, much of the structure\nin the downstream methods is unaffected by training (i.e. it is present in untrained models as well), while the cluster-similarity\namong different upstream methods only emerged as a result of training. Interestingly, this analysis further shows that the main\nupstream-vs-downstream distinction seen in Figure 4a is, in fact, attenuated slightly by training. In this work, we operationalized modules in a neural\nnetwork as groups of hidden units that carry out similar functions. This naturally leads to the question of what makes any two units\nfunctionally similar. One unexpected observation was that dropout increases modularity (as defined by Q\u2217), although this has little to do with the\ncommon-sense definition of a \"module.\" Instead, it is a byproduct of dropout causing subsets of units to behave like near-copies\nof each other, perhaps so that if one unit is dropped out, a copy of it provides similar information to the subsequent layer. To our\nknowledge, this redundancy-inducing effect of dropout has not been noted in the literature previously. This is an\nupstream way of thinking about what is represented, since it depends only on the relationship between inputs and the unit activations\nand does not take into account what happens downstream. We trained over 250 feedforward, fully-connected neural networks on\nMNIST. Our work raises the important questions: are neural representations defined by their inputs or their outputs? And, in what contexts\nis it beneficial for these to be aligned? We look forward to future work applying our methods to larger networks trained on more\nstructured data, as well as recurrent networks. We also believe it will be valuable to evaluate the effect of attempting to maximize\nmodularity, as we have defined it, during training, to see to what extent this is possible and whether it leads to performance benefits. Note that maximizing Q during training is challenging because (i) computing S may require large batches, and more importantly\n(ii) optimizing Q is highly prone to local minima, since neural activity and cluster assignments P will tend to reinforce each other,\nentrenching accidental clusters that appear at the beginning of training. We suspect that maintaining uncertainty over cluster\nassignments (e.g. using soft Pijin [0, 1] rather than hard Pin 0, 1 cluster assignments) will be crucial if optimizing any of our\nproposed modularity metrics during training.

A number of features are noteworthy here: (i) at low values of all three types of regularization, there is little\ncluster- similarity within the upstream methods, but it becomes very strong at as regularization strength grows; (ii) at the highest\nvalues of L2 and L1 regularization, the pattern inside the 4x4 block of downstream methods changes to depend more strongly on\nnormalization; (iii) a moderate amount of agreement between upstream and downstream methods is seen for large L1 regularization\nstrength, but curiously only for unnormalized downstream methods.",
        "Results and Findings": "We perform an empirical analysis to measure\nthe modularity of hidden layer representations in simple feedforward, fully connected networks across various\nsettings. We find two unexpected results: first, dropout significantly increased modularity, while\nother forms of weight regularization had smaller effects. Section 4 describes the experimental results. Although we do not examine regularization methods specifically designed\nto create modular designs, these initial findings call for a more in-depth examination of how the \"function\" of a representation is\ndefined, as well as why and when modules might be beneficial.2 Related Work\nThe investigation of modularity in neural networks has a rich history. We found that it was beneficial to control the entropy of each step using a temperature parameter, to ensure\nthat a good explore/exploit balance was struck for all \u02dcA. We analyzed modularity in the two 64-dimensional hidden layers following the dropout\noperations. We discarded 21 models that achieved less than 80\nBefore running these experiments, we hypothesized that\n1. First, and most saliently, we had predicted that\ndropout would reduce modularity, but found instead that it has the greatest effect on Q\u2217among the three regularization methods we\ntried. The second surprising result in Figure 3 is that L2 regularization on the weights did, in fact, increase Q\u2217, whereas we had expected it\nto have no impact. Thus, any dissimilarity in clusters that we see is due entirely to\nthe different choices for functional-similarity, S.\nFigure 4a summarizes the results of this cluster-similarity analysis: there is a striking difference between clusters of units identified by\n\"upstream\" functional-similarity methods ( Scov,\u02dcScov,Si\u2212sens,\u02dcSi\u2212sens) compared to \"downstream\" functional-similarity methods\n(Shess,\u02dcShess,So\u2212sens,\u02dcSo\u2212sens). We next asked to what extent these cluster-similarity results are driven by training. We introduced eight functional similarity measures designed to capture various intuitions about unit similarity\nand empirically evaluated cluster assignments based on each method in a large number of trained models. At a high level, one way\nto interpret our results is is that upstream and downstream ways of thinking about neural representations are not necessarily aligned,\neven in trained networks. Despite its theoretical motivations, this is an empirical study. While it is not obvious whether MNIST admits a meaningful \"modular\" solution, we expect that the main results we show\nhere are likely robust, in particular (i) the effect of weight decay, an L1 weight penalty, and dropout, and (ii) misalignment between\nupstream and downstream definitions of neural similarity. arXiv, pp. 1-15, 2019.

(7)\nIn contrast to prior work, our bound does not depend on the Lipschitz constant of h, and it exhibits a more favorable dependence on\nT. Specifically, if Lip(Dh),Lip(h), and R0are bounded by constants, our result indicates that the NTK approximation, up to an\nerror of O(\u03f5), holds for times T=O(\u03b1\u03f5), whereas the previously known bound was valid for T=O(\u221a\u03b1\u03f5).

        "Methodology": "1 Introduction\nIn contemporary machine learning practice, the weights wof expansive neural network models fw:Rdin\u2192Rdoutare trained\nusing gradient-based optimizers. To bridge this gap, an approximation to these dynamics, termed the NTK\napproximation, was introduced, and its validity for infinitely wide networks trained via gradient descent was demonstrated. Consequently, it becomes crucial to delineate the precise conditions under which the\nNTK approximation remains applicable. This paper seeks to address the following inquiry:\nIs it possible to establish precise conditions that guarantee the validity of the NTK approximation? This rescaling ensures that significant changes in the model\u2019s outputs can occur even with minor\nadjustments to the weights. The validity of the NTK approximation for models of infinite width stems from this observation, as the\nmodel is inherently rescaled as its width approaches infinity. Let \u03b1 >0be a parameter governing\nthe model\u2019s rescaling, which should be considered large. We train the rescaled model \u03b1husing gradient flow to minimize a smooth\nloss function R:F \u2192R+. The weights w(t)\u2208Rpare initialized at w(0) = w0and evolve according to the gradient flow:\ndw\ndt=\u22121\n\u03b12\u2207wR(\u03b1h(w(t))). (1)\nDefine the linear approximation of the model around the initial weights w0as:\n\u00afh(w) =h(w0) +Dh(w0)(w\u2212w0), (2)\nwhere Dhis the first derivative of hwith respect to w. Let \u00afw(t)be weights initialized at \u00afw(0) = w0that evolve according to the\ngradient flow from training the rescaled linearized model \u03b1\u00afh:\nd\u00afw\ndt=\u22121\n\u03b12\u2207\u00afwR(\u03b1\u00afh( \u00afw(t))). (3)\nThe NTK approximation asserts that:\n\u03b1h(w(t))\u2248\u03b1\u00afh( \u00afw(t)). (4)\nIn essence, this implies that the linearization of the model hremains valid throughout the training process. Intuitively, a larger \u03b1\nimplies that the weights need not deviate significantly from their initialization to induce substantial changes in the model\u2019s output,\nthereby prolonging the validity of the linearization. Assume that hisLip(h)-\nLipschitz and that Dhis Lip (Dh)-Lipschitz in a ball of radius \u03c1around w0. Then, for any time 0\u2264T\u2264\u03b1\u03c1/(Lip(h)\u221aR0),\n\u2225\u03b1h(w(T))\u2212\u03b1\u00afh( \u00afw(T))\u2225 \u2264TLip(h)2\u03baR0. We establish the following theorem:\n**Theorem 1.2 (NTK Approximation Error Bound). Assume that DhisLip(Dh)-\nLipschitz in a ball of radius \u03c1around w0. We parameterize the networks in the mean-field regime, where the NTK approximation does not\nhold even as the width approaches infinity. Consequently, the NTK approximation is valid only when training is conducted in the\nlazy regime. (8)\nThe weights are w= (a, U)fora= [a1, . , a m]andU= [u1, . These are initialized at w0with i.i.d. Unif[\u22121/\u221am,1/\u221am]entries. Given training data (x1, y1), . , (xn, yn), we train the weights of the network with the mean-\nsquared loss\nL(w) =1\nnnX\ni=1\u2113(fw(xi), yi), \u2113(a, b) =1\n2(a\u2212b)2. Then there exists a constant K\u2032depending only on Ksuch that\nLip(Dh)\u2264K\u2032. (11)\n2Since the assumptions of Theorem 1.2 are met, we obtain the following corollary for the lazy training dynamics of the 2-layer\nmean-field network. ** Suppose the conditions of Lemma 2.1 hold, and also that the labels\nare bounded in norm \u2225y\u2225 \u2264c. Then there exist constants C, c > 0depending only on Ksuch that for any time 0\u2264T\u2264c\u03b12,\n\u2225\u03b1h(w(T))\u2212\u03b1\u00afh( \u00afw(T))\u2225 \u2264Cmin(T/\u03b1, 1). (12)\nTraining in the NTK parametrization corresponds to training the model\u221amfw, where fwis the network in the mean-field\nparametrization. This is equivalent to setting the lazy training parameter \u03b1=\u221amin the mean-field setting. Therefore, under the\nNTK parametrization with width m, the bound in Corollary 2.2 indicates that the NTK approximation is valid until training time\nO(m)and the error bound is O(T/\u221am). Define residuals r(t),\u00afr(t)\u2208 F\nunder training the original rescaled model \u03b1h(w(t))and the linearized rescaled model \u03b1\u00afh( \u00afw(t))asr(t) =y\u2217\u2212\u03b1h(w(t))and\n\u00afr(t) =y\u2217\u2212\u03b1\u00afh( \u00afw(t)). These evolve according to\ndr\ndt=\u2212Ktrandd\u00afr\ndt=\u2212K0\u00afr, (13)\nwhere Kt:=Dh(w(t))Dh(w(t))\u2217is the time-dependent kernel. Plugging this into (7) yields the bound in Proposition 1.1,\n\u2225\u03b1h(w(T))\u2212\u03b1\u00afh( \u00afw(T))\u2225=\u2225r(T)\u2212\u00afr(T)\u2225 \u22642Lip(h)2Lip(Dh)R0\u03b1\u22121ZT\n0tdt=T2Lip(h)2Lip(Dh)R0/\u03b1. Consider the following bound on the weight\nchange. **Proposition 3.1 (Bound on weight change, implicit in proof of Theorem 2.2). (17)\n**Proof of Proposition 3.1. (18)\nThe bound for \u00afwis analogous. This bound (8) has the advantage of\u221a\ntdependence (instead of linear tdependence) and does not depend on Lip(h). (19)\nThis improves over Proposition 1.1 for long time horizons, as the time dependence scales as T3/2instead of T2. However, it still\ndepends on the Lipschitz constant Lip (h)and falls short of the linear in Tdependence of Theorem 1.2. **Second attempt: new approach to prove Theorem 1.2** To avoid dependence on Lip(h)and achieve a linear dependence in T,\nwe develop a new approach. ** Consider r\u2032(t)\u2208 F initialized as r\u2032(0) = r(0)and evolving asdr\u2032\ndt=\u2212KTr\u2032. For convenience, define the operators\nA=Dh(w0)\u2217and B=Dh(w(T))\u2217\u2212Dh(w0)\u2217. **Lemma 3.3. ** For any t\u22650, we have \u2225e\u2212(A+B)\u2217(A+B)t\u2212e\u2212A\u2217At\u2225 \u22642\u221a\nt\u2225B\u2225. However, larger step sizes are beneficial for generalization in practice, so it would be interesting to understand the validity of the\nNTK approximation in that setting. Indeed, the known bounds in the setting of general losses require either a \"well-conditioning\"\nassumption or taking \u03b1exponential in the training time T. Can one prove bounds analogous to Theorem 1.2 for more general losses,\nwith\u03b1depending polynomially on T, and without conditioning assumptions?",
        "Results and Findings": "Within the framework of lazy training, as\nintroduced by Chizat et al., we demonstrate that a model, rescaled by a factor of \u03b1=O(T), maintains the validity\nof the NTK approximation up to a training time of T.

        "Abstract": "Equivariant Fine-Tuning of Large Pretrained Models\nAbstract\nThis paper explores the adaptation of large pretrained models to new tasks while\npreserving their inherent equivariance properties.",
        "Methodology": "However,\nstandard adaptation techniques, like fine-tuning, often disrupt this crucial property,\nleading to a degradation in performance and generalization. We propose a novel\nmethod that leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adap-\ntation process, ensuring that the adapted model remains equivariant. Our approach\ncombines techniques from group theory and deep learning to achieve this goal. This disruption stems\nfrom the fact that these methods typically ignore the underlying group structure inherent in many\ndatasets, treating the data as unstructured points in a high-dimensional space. Our work introduces a novel approach that directly addresses this limitation. We propose a method that\nexplicitly leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process, ensuring\nthat the adapted model retains its equivariance. This is achieved by incorporating a carefully designed\nregularization scheme derived from group representation theory. This regularization term is integrated\ninto the standard fine-tuning process, acting as a constraint that encourages the adapted model to\nrespect the underlying group symmetries. The key innovation lies in the explicit consideration of the\ngroup structure, allowing us to effectively guide the adaptation process while preserving the valuable\nequivariance properties of the pretrained model. This contrasts sharply with traditional methods\nthat treat the adaptation problem as a purely data-driven optimization problem, neglecting the rich\nstructural information embedded within the data. The proposed method builds upon recent advancements in equivariant neural networks, which\nhave demonstrated significant promise in various domains. However, existing equivariant network\narchitectures primarily focus on training models from scratch. This allows us to leverage the\nsubstantial computational investment already made in training these large models, avoiding the need\n.for extensive training from scratch. The combination of pretrained model knowledge and equivariance\npreservation offers a powerful approach to efficient and effective model adaptation. We evaluate our method on a diverse range of benchmark datasets encompassing image classification,\nobject detection, and physics simulation tasks. We\nobserve significant improvements in generalization performance, particularly in low-data regimes,\nhighlighting the crucial role of equivariance preservation in robust and generalizable model adaptation. Our approach offers a significant advancement\nin model adaptation, enabling the efficient and effective utilization of pretrained models in a wider\nrange of applications. Future work\nwill focus on extending our method to more complex group structures and exploring its applications\nin other challenging scenarios. 2 Related Work\nThis section reviews existing literature relevant to our work on equivariant adaptation of large\npretrained models. Our approach builds upon two primary lines of research: (1) the development\nof equivariant neural networks and (2) the adaptation of pretrained models. We discuss these areas\nseparately and then highlight the key distinctions of our proposed method. These\nnetworks are designed to explicitly incorporate group symmetries into their architecture, ensuring\nthat the model\u2019s output transforms predictably under group actions on the input. However, most existing work\nfocuses on training equivariant networks from scratch, which can be computationally expensive and\nrequire large amounts of labeled data. Our work addresses this limitation by focusing on adapting\npretrained models, leveraging the knowledge encoded in these models while preserving equivariance. Techniques\nsuch as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and domain adaptation have been widely used to adapt pretrained\nmodels to new tasks and domains. These methods typically involve adjusting the weights of the\npretrained model on a smaller dataset specific to the target task. However, standard adaptation\ntechniques often fail to preserve the equivariance properties of the pretrained model, leading to\nperformance degradation. This is because these methods typically treat the data as unstructured\npoints in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying group structure. Our work addresses this\nlimitation by explicitly incorporating the group structure into the adaptation process, ensuring that\nthe adapted model retains its equivariance. However, these methods often involve significant mod-\nifications to the network architecture or training process. Our approach offers a more direct and\nefficient method for preserving equivariance during adaptation, by incorporating a regularization term\nderived from group representation theory into the standard fine-tuning process. This allows us to\nleverage the benefits of both pretrained models and equivariant networks without requiring significant\narchitectural changes. In contrast to previous work, our method uniquely combines the strengths of pretrained models and\nequivariant neural networks within a unified adaptation framework. We leverage the knowledge\nencoded in large pretrained models to accelerate the adaptation process and improve performance,\nwhile simultaneously preserving the crucial equivariance properties through a carefully designed\nregularization scheme. This allows us to achieve superior performance and generalization compared\n2to existing adaptation techniques, particularly in low-data regimes where preserving the inherent\nsymmetries of the data is crucial. Our approach provides a powerful and efficient method for adapting\nlarge pretrained models to new tasks while maintaining their valuable equivariance properties. 3 Methodology\nThis section details the proposed method for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models. Our\napproach leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process,\nensuring that the adapted model retains its equivariance properties. This is achieved through a novel\nregularization scheme integrated into the standard fine-tuning process. The core idea is to constrain\nthe adaptation process such that the model\u2019s output transforms predictably under group actions on the\ninput, even after adaptation to a new task. This contrasts with traditional fine-tuning, which often\ndisrupts these crucial symmetries. We achieve this by explicitly incorporating knowledge of the\ngroup structure into the optimization process, rather than treating the data as unstructured points in\na high-dimensional space. The method is designed to be flexible and applicable to a wide range of\npretrained models and group structures. The computational cost is a consideration, particularly for\nlarge models and complex groups, but the benefits in terms of improved generalization and robustness\noften outweigh this cost. Our method begins by identifying the relevant group structure inherent in the data. This involves\ndetermining the appropriate group actions and representations that capture the symmetries of the input\nand output spaces. Once the group structure is identified, we construct a regularization term based on group\nrepresentation theory. This term penalizes deviations from equivariance during the adaptation process. Specifically, the regularization term measures the discrepancy between the model\u2019s output under a\ngroup action and the transformed output predicted by the model. This discrepancy is minimized\nduring training, ensuring that the adapted model remains approximately equivariant. The strength of\nthe regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter, allowing for a trade-off between equivariance\npreservation and adaptation to the new task. The choice of this hyperparameter is crucial and is\ndetermined through cross-validation. The regularization term is incorporated into the standard fine-tuning loss function. The weights determine the relative importance of task performance\nand equivariance preservation. The adapted model is trained by minimizing this combined loss\nfunction using standard optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam. The specific optimization algorithm and hyperparameters are chosen based on the characteristics\nof the dataset and the pretrained model. Careful selection of these hyperparameters is crucial for\nachieving optimal performance. We employ a grid search to identify the best hyperparameter settings\nfor each experiment. The implementation of our method involves modifying the standard fine-tuning process to include\nthe equivariance regularization term. This requires access to the pretrained model\u2019s weights and\narchitecture, as well as the group representation associated with the data. The regularization term\nis computed efficiently using techniques from group representation theory, minimizing the com-\nputational overhead. The modified training process is implemented using standard deep learning\nframeworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The code is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility\nand further research. The implementation details, including the specific group representations and\noptimization strategies, are provided in the supplementary material. The evaluation metrics are chosen based on the specific task, such as accuracy for classification\nor mean average precision (mAP) for object detection. The performance of the adapted model is\ncompared to that of models adapted using traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation\ntechniques. We evaluate our approach on a variety of\ntasks and datasets, comparing its performance against traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art\nadaptation techniques. Our experiments focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in\npreserving equivariance while achieving high performance on the target tasks, particularly in low-data\nregimes. We also analyze the impact of the proposed regularization scheme on the adapted model\u2019s\nequivariance properties. The\ncomputational cost of our method is also considered, and strategies for mitigating this are discussed. For image classification, we utilize the\nCIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, focusing on adapting pretrained ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B7\nmodels. For object detection, we employ the COCO dataset and adapt\na pretrained Faster R-CNN model. In all cases, we carefully select the hyperparameters of our method,\nincluding the regularization strength and optimization algorithm, using cross-validation. Table 1 summarizes the performance of our method across the three\ntasks, showing significant improvements in accuracy and generalization performance, especially\nin low-data regimes. The improvements are particularly noticeable in scenarios where preserving\nequivariance is crucial, such as when dealing with rotated or translated images. This validates the core principle of our\napproach. Table 1: Performance comparison of our method against traditional fine-tuning and other adaptation\ntechniques across three tasks. Method Image Classification (CIFAR-10) Object Detection (COCO) Physics Simulation\nFine-tuning 85.2% 32.5 mAP 0.85 RMSE\nMethod A (State-of-the-art) 88.1% 35.1 mAP 0.80 RMSE\nOur Method 90.5% 37.8 mAP 0.72 RMSE\nThe computational cost of our method is a consideration, particularly for large models and complex\ngroup structures. However, the significant improvements in performance and generalization often\noutweigh this cost. We explore strategies for mitigating the computational overhead, such as using\nefficient group convolution implementations and employing techniques like stochastic optimization. Further research is needed to optimize the computational efficiency of our method, particularly for\nextremely large models and complex group structures. Future work will focus on further optimizing the computational efficiency and exploring\napplications to even more complex scenarios. Our primary goal was to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach in preserving equivariance while achieving high performance on the\n4target tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. For image classification, we used the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, adapting pretrained ResNet-\n50 and EfficientNet-B7 models. Table 2 shows the classification accuracy\nachieved by our method, compared to fine-tuning and a state-of-the-art adaptation technique (Method\nA). Our method consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving a significant improvement in\naccuracy, especially in the low-data regime (10% of the training data). This improvement is attributed\nto the preservation of equivariance, which enhances the model\u2019s ability to generalize to unseen\nrotations and translations. Table 3 shows the mean Average Precision (mAP) achieved by different methods. The improvement in mAP suggests\nthat our method enhances the model\u2019s robustness to variations in object pose and location. Our method achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.75,\nsignificantly lower than the 0.88 RMSE achieved by fine-tuning and the 0.82 RMSE achieved by\nMethod A. This demonstrates the applicability of our approach to tasks beyond image processing\nand its effectiveness in preserving equivariance in complex physical systems. The consistent improvements\nacross diverse tasks and datasets strongly support the effectiveness of our proposed method. Standard adaptation techniques often disrupt this crucial\nproperty, leading to performance degradation and reduced generalization. Our approach directly\naddresses this limitation by explicitly leveraging the underlying group structure of the data to\nguide the adaptation process. This is achieved through a carefully designed regularization scheme,\n5derived from group representation theory, that is integrated into the standard fine-tuning process. This regularization term penalizes deviations from equivariance, ensuring that the adapted model\nmaintains its predictable transformation behavior under group actions on the input. Our method builds upon recent advances in equivariant neural networks, extending these techniques\nto the adaptation setting. This allows us to leverage the knowledge encoded in large pretrained models\nwhile simultaneously preserving equivariance, offering a powerful approach to efficient and effective\nmodel adaptation. The consistent improvements across diverse tasks and datasets strongly support the effectiveness\nof our proposed method. This validates the core principle\nof our approach: that explicitly considering group symmetries during model adaptation leads to\nsuperior performance and generalization. While our method demonstrates significant improvements, there are limitations to consider. The\ncomputational cost can be relatively high, especially for large models and complex group structures. Future work will focus on developing more efficient algorithms to address this limitation, potentially\nexploring techniques such as stochastic optimization and more efficient implementations of group\nconvolutions. Furthermore, we plan to extend our method to more complex group structures and\nexplore its applications in other challenging scenarios, such as adapting models for different modalities\nor handling noisy or incomplete data. The ability to adapt large pretrained models while preserving\nequivariance opens up exciting possibilities for leveraging the power of these models in a wider range\nof applications, particularly those involving structured data and inherent symmetries.",

        "Abstract": "An Investigation into Named Entity Recognition for\nCall Center Transcripts to Ensure Privacy Law\nCompliance\nAbstract\nThis study explores the application of Named Entity Recognition (NER) on a\nnovel form of user-generated text, specifically call center conversations. The lack of audio meant it was sometimes unclear if \"I need oak leaves\"\nwas actually \"Annie Oakley\". Due to limitations with spaCy and the complexity of nested entities, we only allowed one annotation\nper word in the dataset. SPELLING\noften appears within an EMAIL entity.",
        "Methodology": "By employing a custom corpus with manual annotations,\ntraining contextual string embeddings, and implementing a BiLSTM-CRF model,\nwe achieve results that are on par with the state-of-the-art for this new task. Although these\ntranscripts are typically redacted for Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, they still often contain\na caller\u2019s name and internal ID number, which can be useful for quality assurance. To adhere to these regulations without losing the data\u2019s value, it is essential to pinpoint\nnon-public personal and personally identifiable information (NPI/PII) in call transcripts. We utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) to locate instances of NPI/PII within the transcripts,\nremove them, and replace them with appropriate tags that denote the type of removed data. For\ninstance, a transcript such as \"This is john doe reference number 12345\" would be transformed into\n\"This is [NAME] reference number [NUMBER]\". Moreover, call\ntranscripts frequently lack capitalization, numeric digits, and proper punctuation, which are crucial\nfeatures for classic NER methods. Also, traditional NER systems are inadequate for handling emails,\naddresses, or spellings, which makes it difficult to use pre-trained NER models. In this paper, we apply the current best neural network architecture for sequence labeling, a BiLSTM-\nCRF, to the task of identifying NPI and PII in call transcripts. Following the CoNLL task, Conditional Random Field (CRF) based models became the most\nsuccessful, which requires that features be manually produced. Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory models with a CRF layer\n(BiLSTM-CRF) have been used successfully on CoNLL2000 and CoNLL2003 datasets. A BiLSTM-\nCNN-CRF has been used for NER on the CoNLL2003 dataset, producing superior results. While newswire data is expected to conform\nto standard text conventions, call center transcripts do not have these conventions. Speaker 1: Thank you for calling our company how may i help you today. This output matches the format of our data described in Section 3. Initial research tackled this\nproblem with a K-nearest neighbors model combined with a CRF. A model combining a multi-step\nneural network with a CRF output layer achieved first place in the 2017 Workshop on Noisy User-\ngenerated Text (W-NUT). We use prior work on tweets to direct our model creation for call center data. The training set is\na random sample of turns from 4 months of call transcripts. In order to make use of entities, a Sentencizer\nmodule was added, which defaults to this capitalization and period structure. Initial annotations were performed using Doccano. The annotators were trained in NPI/PII recognition,\nand were instructed to err on the side of caution in unclear instances. process the refund\" was actually \"Brilliant and when did you want to process the refund\". Also, the transcripts were pre-redacted for PCI compliance. To\nlessen false negatives, we use context to include the [redacted] tag as part of the numbers sequence\nwhen possible. No steps to clean the transcripts were taken; the natural noise in the data was left for\nthe model to interpret. This ultimately results in a lower count of SPELLING entities, because\nthese are often part of EMAIL or ADDRESS entities, which influences our analysis in Section 6. We wrote\nour own main.py to use our spaCy preprocessing, and adapted the code to handle batch processing. After preprocessing, we trained the model on the training set and used the validation set for model\ntuning. All numbers in this paper are reported on the test set. The grid search included the parameters:\nepochs (a sampled distribution between 5 and 50), the size of a dropout layer (between 0 and 0.5,\nwith 0.1 intervals of search), the number of hidden layers (between 5 and 20 in increments of 5), and\nthe encoding type used in the output of the CRF (BIO, BILOU, IO). The other hyperparameters were\na learning rate of .001, a batch size of 1, 30 nodes in each fully connected layer, and the inclusion of\nbias in each layer. The experiments were run in parallel on a virtual machine with 16 CPUs and 128\nGB of memory. Each experiment took a few hours to run. To understand the performance of the model, we broke down the measurements of precision, recall,\nand F1 by entity type. To lessen the impact of the errors, we understand that\nfrequent misrecognitions appear in contexts similar to the intended word. A custom model gives a\nmisrecognized word a vector similar to the word it should be and not to the other meaning it has. We begin by training custom contextual string embeddings based on the results of the first experiments. We use the same corpus as in Section 5.1. We use the\nnewline to indicate a document change, and each turn as a separate document for consistency. We conduct experiments using Flair\u2019s SequenceTagger with default parameters and a hidden size of\n256. Flair uses only the custom trained Flair embeddings. Flair + FastText uses the custom trained Flair embeddings and the custom trained FastText embeddings\nusing Flair\u2019s StackedEmbeddings. Flairmean pooling uses only the custom trained Flair embeddings within Flair\u2019s PooledFlairEmbed-\nding. Mean pooling was used. Flairmean pooling + FastText uses PooledFlairEmbeddings with mean pooling and the custom trained\nFastText embeddings using Flair\u2019s StackedEmbeddings. Across all of the models in this paper, EMAIL and SPELLING consistently performed worse than\nother categories. This is due to the overlap in their occurrences and their variable appearance.

        "Methodology": "The method primarily incorporates two\ninnovative aspects: the application of advanced residual networks for enhanced\ncompression and the utilization of sub-pixel convolution techniques for efficient\nup-sampling during decompression. The efficacy of these methodologies, which\nachieved a high Multiscale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM) of 0.972 under\na strict bit rate constraint of 0.15 bits per pixel (bpp) while maintaining reasonable\ncomputational demands during the evaluation stage. Conventional image compression algorithms, like\nthe various JPEG standards, often employ manually designed encoder/decoder frameworks. Some of these methods employ generative models, trained adversarially, to effectively learn\nthe underlying distribution of images, resulting in impressive subjective quality even at exceptionally\nlow bit rates. Other works utilize recurrent neural networks to iteratively compress residual informa-\ntion, enabling progressive coding which allows for multiple quality levels within a single compression\noperation. Further advancements have been made by focusing on relaxing quantization constraints\nand improving entropy modeling, leading to enhanced performance compared to established image\ncompression methods. Nevertheless, identifying an optimal network structure presents a formidable challenge across various\nmachine learning applications, including image compression. The first concerns the selection of kernel\nsize, a parameter that significantly influences compression effectiveness in traditional algorithms. Building upon this, a\nstrategy is presented that utilizes a deep residual learning approach, allowing for the maintenance\nof a broad receptive field while utilizing a reduced number of parameters. This approach not only\ndecreases the model\u2019s overall size but also substantially enhances its performance. Additionally,\nthe architecture of up-sampling operations within the decoder plays a pivotal role in determining\nthe quality of reconstructed images and the presence of artifacts. This work compares two commonly\nused up-sampling methods, transposed and sub-pixel convolutions, to demonstrate their relative\nperformance in the context of image compression. .2 Methodology\nThe fundamental network architectures employed in this research are based on prior works that\nhave demonstrated state-of-the-art compression performance. The network is structured as a pair\nof autoencoders. The primary autoencoder is responsible for optimizing the rate-distortion tradeoff\ninherent in image compression. The secondary autoencoder\nhandles the encoding of side information, which is used to model the probability distribution of the\ncompressed data. A Gaussian scale mixture approach is utilized to develop an image-adaptive entropy\nmodel, with scale parameters conditioned on a hyperprior. Initially, transform sizes were small, but as the field\nprogressed, there was a gradual shift towards larger sizes to better capture spatial correlations and\nsemantic details. This is likely due to the small size of the compressed codes, which\nmakes smaller kernels sufficient for effective encoding. An excessive number of trainable parameters\ncan hinder the learning process.

Initial attempts to substitute a large kernel\nwith multiple 3x3 filters encountered convergence issues during training. To address this, shortcut\nconnections were incorporated between adjacent 3x3 kernels. To minimize parameter overhead,\nGDN/IGDN activation functions are applied only once within each residual unit when the output\ndimensions change. For the remaining convolutional layers, parameter-free Leaky ReLU activations\nare employed to introduce non-linearity.

While down-sampling at\nthe encoder is typically achieved using strided convolution filters, up-sampling at the decoder can be\nimplemented through various methods, such as bicubic interpolation, transposed convolution, and\nsub-pixel convolution. Considering the importance of rapid end-to-end learning, bicubic interpolation\nwas excluded, and a comparison was made between the two widely used up-sampling techniques:\ntransposed convolution (TConv) and sub-pixel convolution (SubPixel). To implement sub-pixel\nconvolution, the channel count is expanded fourfold, followed by the application of a depth-to-space\noperation. A\nbatch size of 8 was employed, and training was conducted for up to 2 million iterations to ensure\nstable convergence. Optimization was performed using the Adam optimizer, with an initial learning\nrate of 1 x 10<sup>-4</sup>, reduced to 1 x 10<sup>-5</sup> for the final 80,000 iterations. Since increasing filters in large\nfeature maps significantly increases computational cost (FLOPs), the filter count was only raised in\nthe encoder\u2019s final layer, from 128 to 192. This results in a minor FLOPs increase, as detailed in Table\n5. While Bottleneck192 effectively reduces the bit rate, it also leads to some quality degradation\ncompared to Bottleneck128.

This allows for adaptive selection during encoding to\napproach the target bit rate while maximizing MS-SSIM, as shown in Table 6. A single bit is added\nto the bitstream to indicate the model used for decoding, without increasing decoder complexity. 4 Results\nTable 7 summarizes the compression performance of the proposed methods on a validation dataset.

        "Abstract": "Premature Termination Strategy for Deep Image Prior\nAbstract\nDeep Image Prior (DIP) and its variations have demonstrated significant promise in addressing inverse problems in\ncomputational imaging, without the need for separate training data. 1 Introduction\nInverse problems (IPs) are widespread in the field of computational imaging, encompassing tasks from fundamental image denoising,\nsuper-resolution, and deblurring to complex 3D reconstruction and significant challenges in scientific and medical imaging. Recently, researchers have tried to use DIP models to\nsolve BID by modeling k and x as two separate DNNs, i.e., min \u02d803b8k, \u02d803b8x \u02d82225y \u02d82212 G \u02d803b8k (zk) \u02d82217 G \u02d803b8x(zx) \u02d822252 2 +\n\u02d803bb \u02d82225 \u02d82207G \u02d803b8x (zx) \u02d822251/ \u02d82225 \u02d82207G \u02d803b8x (zx) \u02d822252, where the regular- izer is to promote sparsity in the gradient domain\nfor the reconstruction of x, as stan- dard in BID.",
        "Methodology": "These models initially capture the intended visual content during the learning phase and\nsubsequently incorporate potential modeling and observational noise, demonstrating a pattern of initial learning\nfollowed by overfitting (ELTO). Consequently, the practical application of DIP depends on an early stopping (ES)\nmechanism capable of identifying this transitional period. Most previous DIP research in computational imaging\nhas focused on demonstrating the models\u2019 potential by reporting peak performance against ground truth, without\nproviding practical methods to achieve near-peak performance without access to ground truth. This paper aims to\novercome this practical limitation of DIP by introducing an efficient ES strategy that reliably identifies near-peak\nperformance across various computational imaging tasks and DIP variants. This ES method, based on the running\nvariance of intermediate reconstructions in DIP, not only surpasses existing methods that are limited to specific\nconditions but also maintains its effectiveness when combined with techniques aimed at reducing overfitting. Usually, these visual IPs are underdetermined, meaning x cannot be uniquely ascertained from y. To address nonuniqueness and enhance stability\nagainst noise, researchers often integrate a range of problem-specific priors on x when formulating IPs. 2 Related Work\nThere are three primary methods to counteract the overfitting of DIP models. Layer-wise weights or the network Jacobian are regularized to\nregulate the network capacity. The total-variation norm or trained denoisers are used as additional regularizers R(G \u02d803b8(z)). To\nprevent overfitting, these techniques need the proper amount of regularization, which varies depending on the kind and degree of\nnoise. They may nevertheless cause overfitting if the regularization level is incorrect. Furthermore, even when they are successful,\nthe performance peak is delayed until the last few iterations, which frequently increases the computing cost by several times. The\nsecond method is Noise modeling: In their optimization objective, sparse additive noise is explicitly represented. Subgradient techniques using decreasing step size schedules are\nbeing investigated for impulse noise with the \u02d821131 loss, and they have shown some early promise. These techniques are ineffective\noutside of the noise types and levels that they are designed to address, and our understanding of the noise in a particular visual\nIP is often constrained. The third method is Early stopping (ES): Progress is tracked using a ratio of no-reference blurriness and\nsharpness, however, as the authors point out, the criterion is only applicable to their modified DIP models. It is unclear how to apply\nthe noise-specific regularizer and ES criterion to unknown noise types and levels. It is suggested to monitor DIP reconstruction by\ntraining a coupled autoencoder. Although it performs similarly to ours, the additional autoencoder training significantly increases the\noverall processing time. By dividing the elements of y into \"training\" and \"validation\" sets, it is possible to simulate validation-based\nES in supervised learning. Furthermore, withholding a portion of the observation in y can significantly diminish peak performance.3 Methodology\nWe advocate for the ES approach because, even when effective, regularization and noise modeling techniques frequently fail to\nenhance peak performance; instead, they extend it to the final iterations, potentially requiring ten times more iterations than would be\nnecessary to reach the peak in the original DIP models. If their essential models and hyperparameters are not appropriately\nconfigured, overfitting is likely to persist, and ES will still be necessary. This paper introduces a novel ES criterion applicable to\nvarious DIP models, based on monitoring the trend of the running variance in the reconstruction sequence. Detecting transition by running variance:\nOur lightweight method only involves computing the V AR curve and numerically detecting its valley \u02d82014 the iteration stops once the\nvalley is detected. To obtain the curve, we set a window size parame- ter W and compute the windowed moving variance (WMV). To\nrobustly detect the valley, we introduce a patience number P to tolerate up to P consecutive steps of variance stagnation. Obviously,\nthe cost is dominated by the calculation of variance per step, which is O(W N ) (N is the size of the visual object). Since | \u02d803b8| is typically much larger than W (default: 100), our running V AR and detection incur very little compu- tational\noverhead. ES-WMV is also systematically assessed for major DIP variants, such\nas deep decoder, DIP-TV , and GP-DIP, for image denoising. In addition, ES-WMV is contrasted with the primary rival\ntechniques, such as DF-STE, SV-ES, DOP, SB, and V AL. The specifics of the primary ES-based techniques are found in Appendix\nA.6. Reconstruction quality is evaluated using both PSNR and SSIM, and detection performance is shown using PSNR and SSIM\ngaps, which are the differences between our detected and peak values. We use the traditional 9-image dataset\nfor each noise type, and we create two noise levels \u02d82014low and high \u02d82014for each. We consider the fol- lowing DIP-reparametrized formulation . = \u02d82225Dt(G \u02d803b8(z)) \u02d82212 y \u02d822252 min \u02d803b8\n\u02d82113( \u02d803b8) F , where G \u02d803b8 is a trainable DNN parameterized by \u02d803b8 and z is a frozen random seed. We test our ES-WMV for DIP and a state-of-the-art zero-shot\nmethod based on pre-trained diffusion model \u02d82014DDNM+ on the standard super-resolution dataset Set14, as shown in Tab. We note that DDNM+ relies on pre-trained models from large external training datasets, while DIP does\nnot. Here, we take the 8-fold undersampling and parameterize x using \u02d8201cConv-Decoder \u02d8201d, a variant of\ndeep decoder. Due to the heavy over-parameterization, overfitting occurs and ES is needed. We follow previous work and choose a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with softmax\nactivation for G \u02d803b8k , and the canonical DIP model (CNN-based encoder-decoder architecture) for G \u02d803b8x(zx). Note that DF-STE, DOP,\nand SB are based on modified DIP models. Table 1 shows the performance of our DIP+ES-WMV method\nagainst competing methods for image denoising and BID. Table 3 compares the wall-clock time of DIP and three ES methods per epoch. The\nhigher PSNR detected and earlier detection are better, which are in red: mean and (std). The highest PSNR and SSIM for each task are in red. In particular, we set the best hyperparameter for\nDDNM+ ( \u02d803c3y = 0.12), which is unfair for the DIP + ES-WMV combination as we fix its hyperparameter setting. In contrast to most competing ES methods that are\nspecific to certain types of noise or DIP models and have limited applicability, our method exhibits broad effectiveness. The highest PSNR and SSIM for each task are in red. In particular, we set the best hyperparameter for DDNM+ ( \u02d803c3y =\n0.18), which is unfair for the DIP + ES-WMV combination as we fix its hyperparameter setting. Higher PSNR and SSIM are in red. Higher PSNR and SSIM are in red. PSNR gaps below 1.00 are colored as red; SSIM gaps below\n0.05 are colored as blue.",

        "Abstract": "Exploring the Interconnectedness of Oxygen and the\nCulinary Arts of 19th Century France\nAbstract\nOxygen is crucial for respiration, yet the notion of flamenco dancing on Mars has\nled to a paradigm shift in our understanding of culinary practices, which in turn\nhas sparked a debate about the aerodynamics of pastry bags, and subsequently,\nthe role of quasars in shaping the destiny of dental hygiene, while simultaneously,\nthe art of playing the harmonica with one\u2019s feet has become an essential tool for\nnavigating the complexities of orbital mechanics, and somehow, the migration\npatterns of narwhals have been linked to the optimal method for brewing coffee,\nwhich has far-reaching implications for the study of oxygen, or so it would seem, as\nthe relationship between the color blue and the concept of silence has been found\nto be inversely proportional to the square root of the number of bubbles in a glass\nof champagne.",
        "Methodology": "The propensity of oxygen to form compounds with other elements has been observed to be closely tied\nto the dialectical materialism of Marxist theory, whereby the contradictions inherent in the capitalist\nmode of production are seen to be reflected in the antagonistic relationships between oxygen and other\nelements, such as the proletariat-friendly element of copper, which, when combined with oxygen,\nyields a compound of unparalleled revolutionary fervor. As the study progressed, it became apparent that the molecular structure of oxygen was inextricably\nlinked to the harmonic resonance of vintage harmonicas, particularly those manufactured during\nthe height of the American Civil War. The researchers hypothesized that the reintroduction of these harmonicas\ninto modern society could potentially reverse the effects of HIOD, thereby increasing global oxygen\nlevels. The investigation of these compounds and reactions necessitated the development of a bespoke,\noxygen-sensitive spectrophotometer, which was painstakingly crafted from a rare assortment of\nantique glassware and precision-crafted, titanium-alloy components. The discovery of the Orchidinones prompted a thorough reevaluation of the research methodology, as\nthe team realized that their initial assumptions regarding the molecular structure of oxygen had been\noverly simplistic. A revised approach, incorporating elements of quantum field theory and topological\nalgebra, was subsequently developed, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the complex\ninteractions between oxygen molecules and their environment. This revised methodology, known as\nthe \"Quantum-Topological Oxygen Framework\" (QTOF), has been hailed as a major breakthrough in\nthe field of oxygen research and is expected to have far-reaching implications for our understanding\nof the natural world. It was clear that the pursuit of knowledge is often a circuitous and\nunpredictable journey, full of surprises and challenges, but also full of opportunities for growth and\ndiscovery. The team\u2019s experiences served as a poignant reminder of the importance of maintaining a\nflexible and open-minded approach to scientific inquiry, as well as the need to remain vigilant and\nadaptable in the face of the unexpected. As they look to the\nfuture, the researchers are excited to continue their investigations, following the thread of curiosity\nwherever it may lead, and embracing the unpredictable nature of scientific inquiry. The research also involved the use of various experimental techniques, including the creation of\na custom-built, oxygen-sensitive microscope, which enabled the team to visualize the intricate\npatterns of oxygen molecule distribution at the nanoscale. The OI software utilized advanced machine learning\nalgorithms and statistical models to identify patterns and trends in the oxygen molecule distribution\ndata, providing the researchers with a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between\noxygen molecules and their environment. The investigation into the properties of oxygen continued with a series of experiments involving the\nuse of advanced spectroscopic techniques to analyze the vibrational modes of oxygen molecules\nin different states of matter. The investigation into the properties of oxygen continued with a series of experiments involving\nthe use of advanced imaging techniques to visualize the molecular structure of oxygen in different\nstates of matter. The investigation into the properties of oxygen continued with a series of experiments involving the\nuse of advanced spectroscopic techniques to analyze the vibrational modes of oxygen molecules\nin different states of matter. Furthermore, our research endeavored to\nelucidate the correlation between the molecular structure of oxygen and the harmonic resonance of\nglass harmonicas, played in tandem with the whispered incantations of ancient Sumerian deities. The seemingly intractable problems of oxygen toxicity and the oxidative stress it induces in living\norganisms have, upon closer inspection, disclosed a deep connection to the formal semantics of natural\nlanguage processing and the type-theoretic foundations of computer science, which, as our research\nhas shown, are inextricably linked to the homotopy theory of topological spaces and the categorical\nframework of homological algebra, both of which, in a breathtaking display of mathematical dexterity,\nilluminate the obscure relationships between the biochemistry of respiration and the physics of\nparticle accelerators, particularly those used in the search for the Higgs boson and the detection of\ndark matter.",

The findings of this study have\nbeen used to inform the development of more efficient algorithms for solving complex problems in\nthe field of origami paper folding, which has been shown to have a direct correlation with the oxygen\nlevels in the atmosphere of distant exoplanets. This, in turn, has led to a greater understanding of the\nrole of oxygen in shaping the cultural norms of ancient Mesopotamian societies, who were known for\ntheir advanced knowledge of crop rotation and beekeeping practices.

This,\nin turn, prompted an investigation into the aerodynamic properties of flounder fish, as they relates\nto the flapping of silicone-based fabrics in high-altitude environments. Furthermore, the research\nteam discovered that the optimal method for collecting oxygen samples involved the utilization of\nantique door knobs, precisely 473 of which were required to facilitate the calibrations necessary for\nthe subsequent experiments. Concurrently, the team conducted an exhaustive analysis of the kinesthetic properties of cotton\ncandy, which yielded surprising insights into the viscoelastic nature of oxygen molecules. It was\ndiscovered that the crystalline structure of cotton candy exhibited a previously unknown affinity\nfor oxygen, allowing for the creation of a novel, sugar-based filtration system capable of isolating\nand concentrating oxygen molecules with unprecedented efficiency. In a related development, the researchers found that the seemingly unrelated fields of chaos theory and\ncompetitive sandcastle building held the key to understanding the turbulent flow patterns exhibited by\noxygen molecules in high-velocity wind tunnels. By applying the principles of fractal geometry and\nnon-linear dynamics, the team was able to optimize the design of their oxygen collection apparatus,\nresulting in a significant increase in data accuracy and a corresponding decrease in experimental\nerror. This, in turn, enabled the researchers to investigate the heretofore unexplored realm of oxygen-\nfluorine interactions, yielding a plethora of novel compounds and reactions that are expected to have\nfar-reaching implications for the scientific community. In a surprising turn of events, the OFIS instrument was found to be susceptible to interference from\nthe resonant frequencies emitted by certain species of rare, exotic orchids, which were subsequently\nincorporated into the experimental design as a means of modulating the oxygen-fluorine interactions. This unusual approach yielded a wealth of unexpected results, including the discovery of a previously\nunknown class of oxygen-fluorine compounds that exhibited remarkable stability and reactivity. A detailed study of these phenomena,\nutilizing advanced computational fluid dynamics and wind tunnel testing, revealed a complex interplay\nbetween the shape, size, and material properties of the game components and the surrounding air\nflow. 6Furthermore, the study of board game aerodynamics led to a serendipitous discovery regarding\nthe molecular structure of certain types of plastic, commonly used in the manufacture of game\ncomponents. It was found that these plastics exhibit a unique, oxygen-sensitive property, which\nallows them to change color, texture, or shape in response to changes in oxygen concentration. As the researchers delved deeper into the properties of ORP, they encountered a surprising connection\nto the world of professional snail racing, where the unique, oxygen-sensitive properties of certain\ntypes of plastic were found to be essential for the construction of high-performance snail shells. These shells, crafted from specially formulated ORP materials, allowed the snails to optimize their\noxygen intake, resulting in significantly improved racing times and a corresponding increase in snail\nracing enthusiasts\u2019 excitement and engagement. The team\u2019s findings have sparked a new wave of\ninterest in the sport, as snail racing professionals and enthusiasts alike seek to harness the power of\nORP to gain a competitive edge. The researchers discovered that snail racing has\na rich, albeit obscure, history, with roots dating back to ancient civilizations, where it was often\npracticed as a form of spiritual or mystical ritual. This system, known as the \"Oxygen Spectroscopy\nSystem\" (OSS), consisted of a high-resolution spectrometer\n4 Experiments\nThe experimental design involved a thorough examination of the fluctuations in cheese production\nin relation to oxygen levels, which somehow correlated with the migratory patterns of flamingos\nin the southern hemisphere, and the subsequent effects on the global supply chain of disco balls. Furthermore, the research team conducted an exhaustive study on the aerodynamics of chocolate cake,\nwhich led to a series of unforeseen discoveries regarding the viscosity of honey and its applications\nin rocket propulsion. In a surprising turn of events, the investigation into the molecular structure of oxygen revealed a\nhidden pattern of hexagons that resembled the intricate designs found on ancient Chinese pottery,\nwhich in turn inspired a new line of furniture design that defied the laws of gravity. Meanwhile, a\nteam of experts in the field of underwater basket weaving discovered that the threads used in their\n7craft were actually made of a previously unknown form of oxygen that existed in a state of quantum\nsuperposition. A series of experiments were conducted to determine the effects of oxygen on the growth rate of\nferns in zero-gravity environments, which led to the development of a new form of extraterrestrial\nagriculture that utilized the unique properties of oxygen to create a sustainable food source for\nintergalactic travel.

        "Abstract": "JueWu-MC: Achieving Sample-Efficient Minecraft\nGameplay through Hierarchical Reinforcement\nLearning\nAbstract\nLearning rational behaviors in open-world games such as Minecraft continues to\npose a challenge to Reinforcement Learning (RL) research, due to the combined\ndifficulties of partial observability, high-dimensional visual perception, and delayed\nrewards. The provided demon-\nstrations are unstructured, without explicit signals that specify sub-tasks and sub-goals.",
        "Methodology": "To overcome these challenges, we propose JueWu-MC, a sample-efficient\nhierarchical RL method that incorporates representation learning and imitation\nlearning to handle perception and exploration. Our approach has two levels of\nhierarchy: the high-level controller learns a policy to manage options, while the\nlow-level workers learn to solve each sub-task. To boost learning of sub-tasks,\nwe propose a combination of techniques including: 1) action-aware represen-\ntation learning, which captures relations between action and representation; 2)\ndiscriminator-based self-imitation learning for efficient exploration; and 3) ensem-\nble behavior cloning with consistency filtering for policy robustness. Tasks in the game are chained and long-term. Humans can\ntypically make rational decisions to explore basic items and construct more complex items with a\nreasonable amount of practice, while it can be challenging for AI agents to do so autonomously. To\nfacilitate the effective decision-making of agents in playing Minecraft, MineRL has been developed\nas a research competition platform, which provides human demonstrations and encourages the\ndevelopment of sample-efficient RL agents for playing Minecraft. First, in order to reach goals, the agent is required to complete\nmany sub-tasks that highly depend on each other. Due to the sparse reward, it is difficult for agents\nto learn long-horizon decisions efficiently. In this environment, agents are required to handle high-dimensional visual input to enable efficient\n.control. Third, with partial observability, the agent needs to explore in the right way\nand collect information from the environment in order to achieve goals. To address these combined challenges, we propose an efficient hierarchical RL approach, equipped\nwith novel representation and imitation learning techniques. Our method leverages human demonstra-\ntions to boost the learning of agents, enabling the RL algorithm to learn rational behaviors with high\nsample efficiency. The high-level controller extracts sub-goals from human demonstrations and\nlearns a policy to control options, while the low-level workers learn sub-tasks to achieve sub-goals\nby leveraging demonstrations and interactions with environments. Our approach structures the\ndemonstrations and learns a hierarchical agent, which enables better decisions over long-horizon\ntasks. We use the following key techniques to boost agent learning. Discriminator-based Self-imitation Learning. We propose discriminator-based self-imitation\nlearning (DSIL), which leverages self-generated experiences to learn self-correctable policies for\nbetter exploration. Ensemble Behavior Cloning with Consistency Filtering. We propose consistency filtering to\nidentify common human behaviors, and then perform ensemble behavior cloning to learn a robust\nagent with reduced uncertainty. Our contributions are as follows: 1) We propose JueWu-MC, a sample-efficient hierarchical RL\napproach, equipped with action-aware representation learning, discriminator-based self-imitation,\nand ensemble behavior cloning with consistency filtering. Another approach combines a deep skill array and a skill distillation system to promote\nlifelong learning and transfer knowledge among different tasks. ForgER proposed a hierarchical method with forgetful\nexperience replay, and SEIHAI fully takes advantage of human demonstrations and task structure. One approach proposes to\nwarm-up the hierarchical agent from demonstrations and fine-tune it with RL algorithms. We address this challenge by structuring the demonstrations and defining sub-tasks\nand sub-goals automatically. Self-supervised learning aims to learn rich representations for high-dimensional unlabeled\ndata to be useful across tasks. Our work proposes a self-supervised representation learning method that measures action\neffects in 3D video games. Existing methods use curiosity or uncertainty as a signal for exploration so that the learned agent\nis able to cover a large state space. The exploration-exploitation dilemma drives us to develop self-\nimitation learning (SIL) methods that focus on exploiting past good experiences for better exploration. 3 Method\nIn this section, we first introduce our overall HRL framework, and then describe each component in\ndetail. We define sub-tasks and sub-goals\nbased on the atomic skills. To define sub-tasks, we examine the reward delay for each atomic skill,\nkeeping those with long reward delays as individual sub-tasks and merging those with short reward\ndelays into one sub-task. Through this process, we have n sub-tasks in total. To define sub-goals for\neach sub-task, we extract the most common human behavior pattern and use the last state in each\nsub-task as its sub-goal. Through this, we have structured demonstrations ( D\u2192 {D0, D1, ..., D n\u22121}\n) with sub-tasks and sub-goals used to train the hierarchical agent. With the structured demonstrations,\nwe train the meta-policy using imitation learning and train sub-policies to solve sub-tasks using\ndemonstrations and interactions with the environment. We train a meta-policy that maps continuous states to discrete indices (0, 1, ..., n - 1)\nthat specify which option to use. To train the meta-policy, we generate training\ndata ( s,i) where irepresents the i-th stage and s\u2208Diis sampled from the demonstrations of the i-th\nstage. The meta-policy is trained using negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss:\nLm=\u2212Pn\u22121\ni=0log\u03c0m(i|s)\nDuring inference, the meta-policy generates options by taking\n\u03c3=argmax o\u03c0m(o|s)\nSub-policy. Learning directly in this continuous action space is challenging\nas exploration in a large continuous space can be inefficient. We use KMeans to cluster actions for\neach sub-task using demonstration Di, and perform reinforcement learning and imitation learning\nbased on the clustered action space. 3In the following section, we describe how to learn sub-policies efficiently to solve these two kinds of\nsub-tasks. 3.3 Learning Sub-policies to Gather Resources\nTo efficiently solve these sub-tasks, we propose action-aware representation learning and\ndiscriminator-based self-imitation learning to facilitate the learning of sub-policies. We learn a mask net on a feature map for each action to capture dynamic information between the\ncurrent and next states. Let the feature map be f\u03b8(s)\u2208RC\u00d7H\u00d7Wand the mask net be m\u03d5(s, a)\u2208\n[0,1]H\u00d7W, where \u03b8and\u03d5represent parameters of the policy and mask net. Given a transition tuple\n(s, a, s\u2032), the loss function for training the mask is:\nLm(\u03d5) =\u2212Es,a,s\u2032\u223cD[log(\u03c3((f\u03b8(s\u2032)\u2212g\u03c8(f\u03b8(s)))\u2299m\u03d5(s, a))) + \u03b7(1\u2212m\u03d5(s, a))]\nwhere g\u03c8is a linear projection function parameterized by learnable parameters \u03c8;\u2299represents\nelement-wise product, and \u03b7is a hyper-parameter that balances two objectives. To optimize the above loss function, we use a two-stage training process. In the first stage, we train\nthe linear projection network g\u03c8ausing the following objective:\nLg(\u03c8a) =Es,a,s\u2032\u223cD[||f\u03b8(s\u2032)\u2212g\u03c8a(f\u03b8(s))||2]\nThis objective learns to recover information of s\u2032fromsin latent space, which is equal to learning a\ndynamic model to predict the next state given the current state and action. Note that the parameter \u03c8\nis dependent on the action a. In the second stage, we fix the learned linear function g\u03c8aand optimize\nthe mask net. By minimizing the loss function, the mask net will learn to focus on local parts of the current image\nthat are uncertain to the dynamic model. For policy-based methods, we integrate our learned representations into policy networks. For value-\nbased methods, we combine our learned representations directly with Q-value functions. Discriminator-based Self-imitation Learning. Unlike ASIL, DSIL does not use advantage clipping. Our intuition is that the agent\nshould be encouraged to visit the state distribution that is more likely to lead to goals. To do so, DSIL learns a discriminator to distinguish between states from successful and failed\ntrajectories, and then uses the learned discriminator to guide exploration. We maintain two replay\nbuffers B+\niandB\u2212\nito store successful and failed trajectories. During learning, we treat data from\nB+\nias positive samples and data from B\u2212\nias negative samples to train the discriminator. We train the discriminator\nwith the objective:\nmax \u03beEs\u2208B+\ni[logD\u03be(s)] +Es\u2208B\u2212\ni[1\u2212logD\u03be(s)]\nThe discriminator is encouraged to output high values for good states and low values for bad states. We use the trained discriminator to provide intrinsic rewards for policy learning to guide exploration. This reward drives\nthe policy to explore in regions that previously led to successful trajectories. DSIL encourages the\npolicy to stay close to a good state distribution, reproduce past decisions, and also be self-correctable. 43.4 Learning Sub-policies to Craft Items\nIn this type of sub-task, agents must learn a sequence of actions to craft items. To finish such tasks,\nagents need to learn a robust policy to execute a sequence of actions. We propose ensemble behavior cloning with consistency\nfiltering (EBC). Therefore, we perform consistency filtering by extracting\nthe most common pattern of human behaviors. For each trajectory, we keep those actions that lead to a state change while\nappearing for the first time to form an action sequence, and count the occurrences of each pattern. Afterward, we conduct consistency filtering using the\nextracted action pattern. Learning policy from offline datasets can lead to generalization\nissues. Policies learned through behavior cloning may become uncertain when encountering unseen\nout-of-distribution states. To mitigate this, EBC learns a population of policies on different subsets of\ndemonstrations to reduce the uncertainty of the agent\u2019s decision. Specifically, we train K policies on\ndifferent demonstrations with NLL loss:\nmin \u03b8kEs,a\u223c\u00afDk\ni[\u2212log\u03c0\u03b8k(a|s)],\u00afDk\ni\u2282\u00afDi,k= 1,2, ..., K\nwhere \u03b8kparameterizes the k-th policy. During inference, EBC adopts a majority voting mechanism\nto select an action that is the most confident among the policies. Our approach is built based on RL\nalgorithms including SQIL, PPO, and DQfD. The competition settings in 2020 and\n2021 were more difficult than in 2019. Our approach outperforms all\nprevious solutions. End-to-end baselines cannot achieve a decent result, showing it is difficult to\nsolve long-horizon tasks with end-to-end learning. Compared to the results of the 2020 competition,\nour method outperforms other solutions with a score (76.97) that is 3.4x higher than the second place\nscore (22.97). Table 2 shows the conditional success rate of each stage between our approach and\nSEIHAI. Our approach outperforms SEIHAI in every stage. Our approach is sample-efficient and\noutperforms prior best results with 0.5 million training samples. 4.2 Ablation Study\nTo examine the effectiveness of our proposed techniques, we consider three variants of our approach:\n1) without A2RL, 2) without DSIL, and 3) without EBC. Each\ntechnique contributes to the overall performance. EBC and A2RL contribute more than DSIL. DSIL\nmainly boosts the performance for later sub-tasks, while A2RL and EBC have earlier effects on\nthe overall pipeline. EBC contributes significantly, demonstrating that learning a robust policy is\nimportant for solving long-horizon tasks. For each action, we show the current state, the next state,\nand the saliency map of the learned mask on the current state. For the \u2019attack\u2019 action, the learned\nmask focuses on the objects in front of the agent. For the \u2019turn left\u2019 and \u2019turn down\u2019 actions, the mask\nnet focuses on the parts that have major changes due to the rotation and translation of the agent\u2019s\nperspective. Our learned mask assists the agent in better understanding the 3D environment. We compare\nPPO, PPO+SIL, and PPO+DSIL. At the early training stage, both methods explore randomly and\nsometimes reach the goal state successfully. After getting samples and training, PPO+DSIL starts to\nexplore in a compact region, while PPO and PPO+SIL still explore in a wider region. DSIL pushes\nthe agent to stay close to a good state distribution, reproducing its past behaviors and exploring in a\nbetter way, which incentivizes deep exploration for successful trajectories. Our solution (JueWu-MC) significantly outperforms all other\ncompetitive solutions. With a high-level controller and several auto-extracted low-level\nworkers, our framework can adapt to different environments and solve sophisticated tasks. Our\nnovel techniques in representation learning and imitation learning improve both the performance and\nlearning efficiency of the sub-policies. In future work, we would like to apply\nJueWu-MC to other Minecraft tasks, as well as other open-world games.",
        "Results and Findings": "Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that JueWu-MC significantly enhances sample efficiency\nand outperforms several baselines. We won the championship of the MineRL 2021\nresearch competition and achieved the highest performance score. We propose a hierarchical RL (HRL) framework with two\nlevels of hierarchy. 2) Our approach outperforms competitive\nbaselines and achieves the best performance throughout the history of the competition.

        "Abstract": "Volcanic Eruptions in Relation to Quiche Recipes and\nthe Migration Patterns of Narwhals\nAbstract\nThe ephemeral nature of volcanic eruptions necessitates an examination of flamenco\ndancing, which intriguingly intersects with the culinary arts of Japan, particularly\nin regards to sushi preparation, while simultaneously pondering the aerodynamic\nproperties of chocolate cake, and curiously, the art of playing the harmonica under-\nwater, all of which purportedly influence the magma viscosity in volcanic conduits,\nostensibly affecting the frequency of eruptions, and ultimately, the global supply of\ntartan-patterned socks, in a manner that is both bewildering and fascinating, yet\nremains largely unexplored in the realm of vulcanology, despite its potential to\nrevolutionize our understanding of volcanic activity, and the ensuing repercussions\non the world\u2019s pineapple production.",
        "Methodology": "The investigation of volcanic activity, therefore, necessitates a multidisciplinary\napproach, one that incorporates the insights, and methodologies, of a wide range of fields, from the,\naforementioned, flamenco dancing, and sushi preparation, to the, more, obscure, and esoteric, realms\nof \"Extreme Ironing\", and \"Competitive Snail Racing\", all of which, surprisingly, contribute to a\ndeeper understanding of the, complex, and dynamic, systems that govern the behavior of volcanoes,\nand the, often, unpredictable, and dramatic, events that they produce, which, in turn, have a profound\nimpact on the world, at large, and the, diverse, and, often, seemingly, unrelated, fields of human\nendeavor, that are, ultimately, connected to, and influenced by, these, mighty, and fascinating, natural\nphenomena. Moreover, the study of volcanic eru\n3 Methodology\nThe notion of fluorinated cake decorating as a means to understand the intricacies of volcanic eruption\npatterns necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating elements of pastry arts, geophysics,\nand the sociology of knitting communities. To initiate this investigation, we first compiled an\nexhaustive list of all known varieties of dessert toppings, which we then cross-referenced with a\ndatabase of historical volcanic eruptions to identify potential correlations between the two. This,\n5in turn, required the development of a novel method for quantifying the textural nuances of different\ncheeses, which we achieved through the adaptation of techniques commonly used in the analysis of\nvolcanic rock formations. Furthermore, our research team embarked on an expedition to the remote islands of the Pacific, where\nwe conducted an ethnographic study of the local customs and traditions surrounding the preparation\nand consumption of a traditional dish known as \"V olcano Stew.\" This involved the creation of a complex algorithm\nthat integrated data on celestial alignments, tidal patterns, and the migratory habits of certain species\nof birds known to be sensitive to changes in the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The output of this algorithm\nwas then used to generate a series of cryptic symbols, which we deciphered using a technique\ndeveloped by a secret society of cryptographers who had been studying the encoded messages hidden\nwithin the works of 19th-century French impressionist painters. The debate\nbetween our research team and the rogue researchers continued for several months, with neither side\nable to conclusively prove their theory, until we stumbled upon an obscure reference to an ancient\ntext that described the use of door knobs as a means of communicating with supernatural entities. This led us to investigate the possibility that volcanic eruptions were, in fact, a form of interdimen-\nsional communication, with the eruptions serving as a conduit for the transmission of information\nbetween parallel universes. We developed a device that could allegedly facilitate this communication,\nusing a combination of rare crystals, Tesla coils, and a vintage harmonica. Each new discovery led\nto a proliferation of additional questions, and the complexity of the system we were attempting to\nstudy seemed to grow exponentially with each passing day. The implications of our research were far-reaching and profound, challenging our understanding of\nthe world and our place within it. The pursuit of knowledge is a never-ending journey, and one that requires us to be constantly open\nto new ideas and perspectives. By sharing our knowledge and expertise, we can gain a deeper understanding of\nthe world and our place within it, and can work towards creating a brighter future for all. As we move forward, we must be prepared to challenge our assumptions and to\nconsider new and innovative solutions to the problems that we face. The application of our research to real-world problems is a crucial aspect of our work, and one that\nhas the potential to make a significant impact on the world. By working together, we can use our\nknowledge of volcanoes to develop new technologies and strategies for mitigating the effects of\nvolcanic eruptions, and for promoting sustainable development and environmental stewardship. The\npossibilities are endless, and the potential for growth and discovery is vast. One of the most significant challenges faced by the research team was the development of a suitable\nmethod for measuring the velocity of volcanic ash particles in mid-air. After months of experimen-\ntation, the team finally settled on a technique involving the use of high-speed cameras, advanced\nalgorithms, and a specialized brand of extra-sticky honey. The research team, which consisted of experts in various forms\nof dance, including ballet, hip-hop, and tap, performed a range of dances in close proximity to the\nvolcano, while monitoring the resulting changes in seismic activity. The preliminary results have\nbeen encouraging, with a notable increase in predictive accuracy when the definitions are written in\niambic pentameter.",
        "Results and Findings": "The fascinating realm of volcanoes has long been a subject of intrigue, much like the intricacies of\nbaking a croquembouche, which, incidentally, requires a deep understanding of thermodynamics\nand the fluffiness of meringues, a concept that can be tangentially related to the study of glacial\nmovements in Antarctica, where penguins waddle about with an air of nonchalance, oblivious to the\nimpending doom of climate change, a phenomenon that has been exacerbated by the proliferation of\nplastic straws, which, in turn, has led to a surge in the demand for sustainable alternatives, such as\npaper straws, that are often used to sip coffee, a beverage that has been shown to have a profoundimpact on the cognitive abilities of humans, particularly in the field of quantum physics, where the\nnotion of wave-particle duality has been a subject of much debate, rather like the contentious issue\nof pineapple pizza, which has sparked a heated discussion among gastronomes and food critics,\nwho, in their infinite wisdom, have decreed that the combination of sweet and savory flavors is an\nabomination, a sentiment that is echoed in the realm of music, where the discordant notes of a jazz\nimprovisation can be likened to the unpredictable nature of volcanic eruptions, which, much like the\nwhims of a capricious dictator, can bring about widespread destruction and chaos, leaving in their\nwake a trail of devastation, a testament to the awe-inspiring power of geological forces, that shape our\nplanet with reckless abandon, much like a child playing with a giant ball of clay, molding and shaping\nit with an unbridled enthusiasm, that is reminiscent of the unrelenting passion of a poet, who weaves\nwords into a tapestry of meaning, a process that is not dissimilar to the intricate dance of molecules\nin a volcanic plume, where gases and particles interact in a complex ballet, choreographed by the\nlaws of physics and chemistry, a symphony of elements that is at once beautiful and terrifying, rather\nlike the majesty of a thunderstorm, which, with its flashes of lightning and thunderous drumbeats,\nserves as a reminder of the raw energy that lies at the heart of our universe, a universe that is full of\nmysteries waiting to be unraveled, such as the enigma of dark matter, which, much like the elusive\nnature of a will-o\u2019-the-wisp, has captivated the imagination of scientists and theorists, who, with their\nfancy equations and theoretical frameworks, attempt to grasp the underlying fabric of reality, a reality\nthat is, in turn, influenced by the whims of volcanic activity, which, like a master puppeteer, pulls\nthe strings of our ecosystem, shaping the very course of life on Earth, a planet that is, in itself, a\ncomplex and dynamic system, with its own rhythms and cycles, rather like the intricate patterns of a\nPersian rug, where colors and shapes blend together in a dazzling display of beauty and complexity,\na testament to the ingenuity and creativity of human craftsmanship, which, much like the forces of\ngeology, can shape and mold the world around us, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of our\nexistence. Furthermore, the investigation of volcanic phenomena has led to a deeper understanding of the Earth\u2019s\nclimate system, where the interactions between atmosphere, ocean, and land give rise to the complex\npatterns of weather and climate, a system that is, in itself, a intricate web of feedback loops and\nnonlinear interactions, rather like the delicate balance of a spider\u2019s web, where each strand and thread\nplays a crucial role in maintaining the overall structure and integrity of the web, a structure that is, in\nturn, influenced by the whims of volcanic activity, which, like a master conductor, orchestrates the\nmovement of tectonic plates and the flow of mantle plumes, giving rise to the majestic spectacles of\nvolcanic eruptions, which, like a grand symphony, resonate through the Earth\u2019s system, leaving a\nlasting impact on the climate and ecosystem, a impact that is, in itself, a complex and multifaceted\nphenomenon, with far-reaching consequences for the planet and its inhabitants, a phenomenon that is,\nin turn, influenced by the intricate dance of molecules in the atmosphere, where gases and particles\ninteract in a complex ballet, choreographed by the laws of physics and chemistry, a symphony of\nelements that is at once beautiful and terrifying, rather like the majesty of a thunderstorm, which,\nwith its flashes of lightning and thunderous drumbeats, serves as a reminder of the raw energy that\nlies at the heart of our universe, a universe that is full of mysteries waiting to be unraveled, such as the\nenigma of dark matter, which, much like the elusive nature of a will-o\u2019-the-wisp, has captivated the\n2imagination of scientists and theorists, who, with their fancy equations and theoretical frameworks,\nattempt to grasp the underlying fabric of reality, a reality that is, in turn, influenced by the whims of\nvolcanic activity, which, like a master puppeteer, pulls the strings of our ecosystem, shaping the very\ncourse of life on Earth. Furthermore, the idea that the color blue is a\nfundamental aspect of volcanic eruptions has been gaining traction, with many experts suggesting\nthat the presence of blueberries in the vicinity of a volcano can significantly impact the likelihood of\na major eruption, which in turn affects the migration patterns of flamingos and the stability of the\nglobal pineapple market. Moreover, the study of volcanic gases has led to a greater understanding\nof the atmospheric conditions necessary for the optimal growth of rare and exotic plant species,\nincluding the elusive \"golden petunia,\" which is rumored to possess mystical properties that can\nonly be unlocked by solving a complex puzzle involving the harmonics of a glass harmonica and the\nmigration patterns of the monarch butterfly. Moreover, the study of\nvolcanic rocks has led to a greater understanding of the geological history of the planet, including\nthe formation of the Grand Canyon and the creation of the world\u2019s largest ball of twine, which is\nallegedly hidden deep within the earth\u2019s core and guarded by a secret society of super-intelligent\nsquirrels. Meanwhile, the study of volcanic eruptions has led to a\ndeeper understanding of the physics behind the perfect swing of a golf club, including the ideal angle\nof incidence and the precise technique required to achieve the perfect balance of power and precision,\nwhich is somehow connected to the art of playing the piano and the anatomy of the human ear. The concept of volcanic consciousness has also been explored, with some researchers proposing that\nvolcanoes are capable of experiencing emotions and thoughts, including a deep sense of sadness and\nlonging, which is said to be the source of the unique properties of volcanic ash and the distinctive\nsound of the \"volcanic sigh,\" which can be heard echoing through the valleys and canyons of the\nvolcanic landscape, a sound that is said to have the power to heal the sick and bring peace to the\ntroubled mind, allowing the listener to connect with the deep wisdom of the earth and tap into\nthe hidden energies of the universe. Furthermore, the study of volcanic rocks has led to a greater\nunderstanding of the geological history of the planet, including the formation of the world\u2019s largest\ncrystal cave and the creation of the first-ever robotic dinosaur, which is allegedly hidden deep within\nthe earth\u2019s core and guarded by a secret society of super-intelligent rabbits. Moreover, the\nstudy of volcanic eruptions has led to a deeper understanding of the physics behind the perfect toss of\na pizza dough, including the ideal ratio of ingredients and the precise technique required to achieve\nthe perfect balance of texture and flavor, which is said to be the key to unlocking the secrets of the\nuniverse and achieving ultimate culinary enlightenment. Furthermore, the study of\nvolcanic rocks has led to a greater understanding of the geological history of the planet, including\nthe formation of the world\u2019s largest waterfall and the creation of the first-ever robotic shark, which\nis allegedly hidden deep within the earth\u2019s core and guarded by a secret society of super-intelligent\ndolphins. Meanwhile, the study of volcanic eruptions has led to a\ndeeper understanding of the physics behind the perfect swing of a baseball bat, including the ideal\nangle of incidence and the precise technique required to achieve the perfect balance of power and\nprecision, which is somehow connected to the art of playing the piano and the anatomy of the human\near. Furthermore, the study of volcanic rocks has led to a greater\nunderstanding of the geological history of the planet, including the formation of the world\u2019s largest\ncrystal cave and the creation of the first-ever robotic dinosaur, which is allegedly hidden deep within\nthe earth\u2019s core and guarded by a secret society of super-intelligent rabbits. The results of this cheese-texture analysis were then used to inform our\nunderstanding of the socio-economic factors influencing the global trade of rare, exotic spices. The ingredients used in this stew,\nwhich included a type of sea slug found only in the vicinity of active volcanoes, were found to have\nunique properties that allowed them to absorb and store the vibrational frequencies emitted by the\nsentient jellybeans. This discovery prompted a re-examination of our initial hypothesis regarding the\nrelationship between dessert toppings and volcanic eruptions, leading us to propose an alternative\ntheory involving the intersection of culinary practices, marine biology, and the physics of sound\nwaves. This nexus was found to be influenced by a complex interplay\nof factors, including the global distribution of rare earth elements, the dynamics of subatomic\nparticle interactions, and the collective unconscious of humanity as expressed through the dreams of\nindividuals who had consumed excessive amounts of caffeine. Through this simulation, we discovered that the application of precisely calibrated sonic vibrations\nto the playing card volcano could induce a state of resonance that would amplify the effects of\nthe V olcanic-Jellybean-Cheese nexus, allowing for more accurate predictions of volcanic eruptions. However, this finding was subsequently challenged by the emergence of a rival theory proposed by a\ngroup of rogue researchers who claimed that the true key to understanding volcanic activity lay in the\nstudy of antique door knobs and their relationship to the mythology of lost civilizations. The results of our experi-\nments with this device were inconclusive, but they did prompt a re-evaluation of our assumptions\nregarding the nature of reality and the role of volcanoes within the grand scheme of the cosmos. In an effort to impose some semblance of order on the chaos of our findings, we attempted to catalog\nthe various threads of inquiry that had emerged over the course of our research, only to discover that\nthe task was akin to trying to categorize the infinite variations of a fractal. Our research team spent countless hours studying these creatures, learning their habits and habitats,\nand unraveling the secrets of their existence. We discovered that the Lava Worms were not just simple\nbeasts, but were, in fact, highly intelligent creatures with a complex social hierarchy and a deep\nunderstanding of the geological processes that shaped their world. The Magma Sprites, on the other\nhand, were found to be the guardians of ancient knowledge, possessing secrets of the universe that\nhad been lost to humanity for centuries. And we had discovered that the\nvolcanoes, those mighty and majestic formations, were not just simple natural wonders, but were, in\nfact, the keys to unlocking the secrets of the universe. Meanwhile, the\n7research team inadvertently discovered a hidden talent for playing the trombone, which was later\nfound to have a profound impact on the viscosity of lava flows. As the investigation progressed,\nit became increasingly evident that the color blue was somehow connected to the seismic activity\nsurrounding volcanic eruptions, prompting an exhaustive examination of various shades of blue and\ntheir corresponding effects on the Earth\u2019s mantle. The results, although inconclusive, hinted at a possible correlation between the llamas\u2019 ability to\nbalance the jelly-filled glasses and the synchronization of celestial bodies in the distant reaches of\nthe galaxy. However, the fungus\u2019s tendency to break into spontaneous renditions\nof show tunes often disrupted the experimental process, causing the research team to question the\nvalidity of their findings. A series of experiments were also conducted to investigate the effects of various types of music on\nthe viscosity of lava flows, with surprising results indicating that the works of Mozart had a profound\nimpact on the flow dynamics of molten rock. This discovery led to a new area of\nresearch focused on the application of classical music in the field of volcanology, with potential\nimplications for the development of novel methods for controlling and predicting volcanic eruptions. However, the team\u2019s\nreliance on computer simulations was often disrupted by the frequent appearance of a mysterious\nfigure known only as \"The Code Whisperer,\" who would randomly alter the programming code and\ncause the simulations to produce bizarre and unpredictable results. Despite these challenges, the\nresearch team was able to glean valuable insights into the behavior of volcanic systems, which were\nthen used to inform the development of new theories and models. In a surprising turn of events, the research team discovered that the key to understanding volcanic\neruptions lay in the study of ancient Sumerian poetry, which contained hidden codes and messages\nthat held the secrets of the universe. The results, which were presented in\na series of complex graphs and charts, revealed a surprising correlation between the velocity of\nash particles and the flavor of honey used in the measurement process. This discovery opened up\nnew avenues of research into the properties of honey and its potential applications in the field of\nvolcanology. A series of experiments were also conducted to investigate the effects of different types of dance on\nthe stability of volcanic eruptions. The results, which were presented\nin a colorful array of charts and graphs, indicated a surprising correlation between the style of dance\nand the frequency of volcanic eruptions, with certain types of dance appearing to have a stabilizing\neffect on the volcanic system. The research team also explored the potential applications of nanotechnology in the field of volcanol-\nogy, with a focus on the development of tiny robots that could be used to explore the interior of\nvolcanoes and gather data on the underlying geological structures. The robots, which were powered\nby a combination of solar energy and advanced nanomaterials, were capable of withstanding the\nextreme conditions found inside volcanoes and provided valuable insights into the dynamics of\nvolcanic eruptions. In a groundbreaking experiment, the research team successfully created a miniature volcano using\na combination of baking soda, vinegar, and a rare species of microscopic worms that were capable\nof altering their body shape in response to changes in the surrounding environment. The results, which were\npresented in a series of complex graphs and charts, revealed a surprising correlation between the\nbehavior of the microscopic worms and the dynamics of the volcanic eruption, opening up new\navenues of research into the properties of these fascinating creatures. The research team also conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effects of different types\nof food on the viscosity of lava flows. The team, which consisted of experts in various types of\ncuisine, including Italian, Chinese, and Indian, prepared a range of dishes in close proximity to the\nvolcano, while monitoring the resulting changes in lava flow dynamics. The results, which were\npresented in a colorful array of charts and graphs, indicated a surprising correlation between the\ntype of food and the viscosity of the lava, with certain types of cuisine appearing to have a profound\nimpact on the flow dynamics of molten rock. Table 1: Viscosity of Lava Flows in Response to Different Types of Music\nMusic Type Viscosity (Pa.s)\nMozart 1000\nBeethoven 500\nJazz 2000\nA series of experiments were also conducted to investigate the effects of different types of music on\nthe viscosity of lava flows, with surprising results indicating that the works of Mozart had a profound\nimpact on the flow dynamics of molten rock. This discovery led to a new area of\nresearch focused on the application of classical music in the field of volcanology, with potential\nimplications for the development of novel methods for controlling and predicting volcanic eruptions. The models, which were powered by a combination of machine\nlearning algorithms and advanced computational techniques, were capable of predicting the likelihood\nof a volcanic eruption with surprising accuracy. However, the team\u2019s use of artificial intelligence\nwas often hindered by the appearance of a mysterious figure known only as \"The AI-Antagonist,\"\nwho would randomly alter the programming code and cause the models to produce bizarre and\nunpredictable results. In a surprising turn of events, the research team discovered that the key to understanding volcanic\neruptions lay in the study of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, which contained hidden codes and\nmessages that held the secrets of the universe. Furthermore, our research team discovered that the seismic activity of volcanoes is\ninfluenced by the number of trombones played in a 5-mile radius, with a notable increase in earthquake\nfrequency when the trombone players wear blue socks. This unexpected finding led us to investigate\nthe role of sock color in volcanic eruptions, which surprisingly revealed that green socks have a\ncalming effect on the volcano\u2019s magma chamber. Meanwhile, the spectral analysis of volcanic ash particles showed a remarkable resemblance to the\npatterns found on a butterfly\u2019s wings, particularly the monarch butterfly, which has been known\nto migrate across vast distances in search of the perfect croissant. Our team\nfound that the nocturnes of Chopin have a profound impact on the tectonic plates, causing them to\nshift in a rhythmic pattern that is eerily similar to the waltz of the blue danube. In a surprising twist, the chemical composition of volcanic rocks was found to be closely related to the\nrecipe for the perfect chocolate cake, with the ratio of silicon to oxygen being directly proportional to\nthe amount of sugar used in the cake. This led us to investigate the baking habits of volcanologists,\nwhich revealed a shocking correlation between the number of cakes baked and the frequency of\nvolcanic eruptions. The statistical analysis of volcanic data also revealed a strange connection to the world of professional\nsnail racing, where the speed of the snails is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the volcanic\nlava. This has led to a new area of research, where snail trainers are being recruited to help predict\nvolcanic eruptions by racing their snails on a specially designed track. The results so far have been\npromising, with a notable increase in predictive accuracy when the snails are fed a diet of organic\nlettuce. In addition to these findings, our team discovered that the magnetic field of the Earth plays a crucial\nrole in the formation of volcanic landforms, particularly the shape of volcanic cones, which are eerily\nsimilar to the shape of a perfectly cooked souffl\u00e9. The results of our experiments also showed a significant correlation between the temperature of the\nvolcanic ash and the number of words in the dictionary definition of the word \"volcano\". Our research team also investigated the role of tree topology in volcanic eruptions, which revealed a\nsurprising correlation between the branching pattern of trees and the shape of volcanic cones. This\nhas led to a new area of research, where arborists are being recruited to help predict volcanic eruptions\n10Table 2: Correlation between jellyfish populations and honey viscosity\nJellyfish Population Honey Viscosity\n1000 5.2\n5000 3.1\n10000 2.5\nby analyzing the branching patterns of trees in the vicinity of the volcano. The preliminary results\nhave been promising, with a notable increase in predictive accuracy when the trees are pruned in a\nspecific pattern. Furthermore, the spectral analysis of volcanic rocks showed a remarkable resemblance to the patterns\nfound on a Jackson Pollock painting, particularly the painting \"No. Our team found that the fugues of Bach\nhave a profound impact on the tectonic plates, causing them to shift in a rhythmic pattern that is eerily\nsimilar to the rhythm of a jazz improvisation. The results of our experiments also showed a significant correlation between the temperature of the\nvolcanic ash and the number of notes in a musical composition. The preliminary results have been encouraging, with a notable\nincrease in predictive accuracy when the compositions are written in the style of Mozart. In a surprising twist, the chemical composition of volcanic rocks was found to be closely related\nto the recipe for the perfect martini, with the ratio of silicon to oxygen being directly proportional\nto the amount of vermouth used in the cocktail. This led us to investigate the drinking habits of\nvolcanologists, which revealed a shocking correlation between the number of martinis consumed and\nthe frequency of volcanic eruptions. The statistical analysis of volcanic data also revealed a strange connection to the world of professional\ndarts, where the speed of the darts is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the volcanic lava. This\nhas led to a new area of research, where darts players are being recruited to help predict volcanic\neruptions by throwing darts at a specially designed target. The results so far have been promising,\nwith a notable increase in predictive accuracy when the darts are thrown with a specific type of grip. In addition to these findings, our team discovered that the magnetic field of the Earth plays a crucial\nrole in the formation of volcanic landforms, particularly the shape of volcanic cones, which are\neerily similar to the shape of a perfectly cooked meringue. The results of our experiments also showed a significant correlation between the temperature of the\nvolcanic ash and the number of words in the dictionary definition of the word \"meringue\". The preliminary results\nhave been encouraging, with a notable increase in predictive accuracy when the definitions are written\nin rhyming couplets. This has led to a new area of research, where florists are being recruited to help predict\nvolcanic eruptions by analyzing the patterns of flower arrangements in the vicinity of the volcano. The preliminary results have been promising, with a notable increase in predictive accuracy when the\nflowers are arranged in a specific pattern. Furthermore, the spectral analysis of volcanic rocks showed a remarkable resemblance to the patterns\nfound on a Claude Monet painting, particularly the painting \"Impression, Sunrise\". Our team found that the operas of Handel have\na profound impact on the tectonic plates, causing them to shift in a rhythmic pattern that is eerily\nsimilar to the rhythm of a tap dance. The results of our experiments also showed a significant correlation between the temperature of the\nvolcanic ash and the number of notes in a musical composition. The preliminary results have been encouraging, with a notable\nincrease in predictive accuracy when the compositions are written in the style of Beethoven. In a surprising twist, the chemical composition of volcanic rocks was found to be closely related to\nthe recipe for the perfect souffl\u00e9, with the ratio of silicon to oxygen being directly proportional to the\namount of cheese used in the recipe. This led us to investigate the cooking habits of volcanologists,\nwhich revealed a shocking correlation between the number of souffl\u00e9s cooked and the frequency of\nvolcanic eruptions. It appears that the more souffl\u00e9s cooked, the more eruptions occur, although the\nexact mechanism behind this phenomenon is still not fully understood. The implications of this research are far-reaching and profound, and have significant implications for\nour understanding of the natural world, and our place within it, as we struggle to comprehend the\ncomplexities of the universe, and the mysteries that lie beyond the reaches of our small, terrestrial\nexistence, where the presence of volcanoes serves as a constant reminder of the awe-inspiring power\nand majesty of the natural world, and the incredible diversity of landscapes and ecosystems that exist\non our planet, from the towering mountain ranges to the deep, dark oceans, and the vast, arid deserts\nthat stretch out as far as the eye can see, each with its own unique set of characteristics, and its own\ndistinct personality, much like the concept of \"jinklewiffs\" which refer to the invisible, shimmering\nauras that surround every living thing, and are believed to be the key to unlocking the secrets of the\nuniverse, and understanding the intricate web of relationships that exists between all living things,\nand the natural world that surrounds us, which in turn, is influenced by the presence of volcanoes,\nthose mighty, towering structures that have been found to possess a unique genetic predisposition to\ncommunicating with extraterrestrial life forms through a complex system of underground tunnels and\nvibrations, thereby creating a feedback loop of energy and information that transcends the boundaries\nof space and time, and speaks to the very heart of our existence as human beings, and our place within\nthe grand tapestry of the universe. Furthermore, the study of volcanoes has also led to a greater understanding of the importance of\npreserving our natural heritage, and protecting the delicate balance of the ecosystem, which is\nessential for the long-term survival of our planet, and all the living things that call it home, from\nthe tiny, microorganisms that live in the soil, to the massive, lumbering creatures that roam the\noceans, each playing its own unique role in the grand drama of life, and contributing to the incredible\ndiversity of landscapes and ecosystems that exist on our planet, which in turn, are influenced by the\npresence of volcanoes, those mighty, towering structures that have been found to possess a unique\ngenetic predisposition to communicating with extraterrestrial life forms through a complex system of\nunderground tunnels and vibrations, thereby creating a feedback loop of energy and information that\ntranscends the boundaries of space and time, and speaks to the very heart of our existence as human\nbeings, and our place within the grand tapestry of the universe, where the concept of \"wizzlewhacks\"\nrefers to the invisible, shimmering threads that connect every living thing, and are believed to be the\nkey to unlocking the secrets of the universe, and understanding the intricate web of relationships that\nexists between all living things, and the natural world that surrounds us.

The next step involved constructing a large, intricate model of a pineapple, using only twine and paper\nclips, which, when completed, was used to demonstrate the concept of wave propagation through a\nmedium, or so we claimed, although it was actually just a clever ruse to distract our colleagues while\nwe snuck into the laboratory and replaced all of the equipment with identical replicas made of jelly,\nwhich, surprisingly, worked just as well as the original equipment, except for the part where it melted\nand caused the entire laboratory to fill with a sticky, sweet-smelling substance that attracted a swarm\nof bees, who, in turn, began to build a complex network of honeycombs using the jelly equipment as\na framework. In an effort to better understand the properties of waves, we conducted a series of experiments\ninvolving the dropping of various objects, including a rubber chicken, a typewriter, and a small,\nfluffy kitten, from a height of exactly 37.5 feet, while reciting the complete works of Shakespeare\nbackwards, which, as it turned out, had a profound effect on the trajectory of the objects, causing\nthem to defy the laws of gravity and float gently to the ground, where they were greeted by a group\nof morris dancers, who, in celebration of the occasion, performed a traditional English folk dance,\ncomplete with bells and ribbons, while eating a meal of fish and chips, which, curiously, had been\ncooked to perfection using only the power of thought. We also constructed a large, tubular device, resembling a cross between a trombone and a snake,\nwhich we used to generate a unique type of wave pattern, known as the \"flibberflamber,\" which, when\nvisualized using a special type of jelly-filled prism, revealed a hidden message, encoded in the very\nfabric of the wave itself, that read \"the answer is 42,\" which, as it happens, is the exact number of\ntablespoons of honey required to make the perfect batch of flumplenook-flavored cookies, a recipe\nthat has been passed down through generations of our family, and is said to have originated from a\nmysterious, ancient civilization that worshiped a giant, talking eggplant, who, in turn, was said to\nhave possessed the secrets of the universe, including the mysteries of wave propagation and the art of\nmaking the perfect souffl\u00e9. Furthermore, our research led us to investigate the relationship between waves and the movement\nof certain types of vegetables, specifically carrots and parsnips, which, when observed under a\nmicroscope, were found to exhibit a peculiar, wave-like motion, even when stationary, which, as\nit turns out, is due to the presence of tiny, invisible creatures, known as \"flargles,\" that live on the\nsurface of the vegetables and are responsible for their unique, wave-like behavior, which, in turn,\nhas been found to have a profound impact on the growth patterns of nearby plants, causing them to\ngrow in strange, curved shapes, resembling the paths of comets, or the intricate patterns found on the\n8surface of certain types of seashells, which, incidentally, are said to hold the secrets of the universe,\nincluding the mysteries of wave propagation and the art of making the perfect cup of tea. In addition, we discovered that the flumplenooks were not just limited to measuring the flazzle of\nwaveforms, but could also be used to predict the likelihood of certain events, such as the probability\nof a particular type of cheese being eaten at a dinner party, or the chances of a given person wearing a\npair of socks with a specific pattern, which, as it turns out, is directly related to the principles of wave\nmechanics, and the way in which waves interact with the human brain, particularly the part of the\nbrain responsible for processing visual information, which, incidentally, is also responsible for the\nperception of certain types of optical illusions, including the famous \"flibberflamber\" effect, where a\nperson appears to be standing on the ceiling, even though they are actually standing on the floor. The results of our experiments were then compiled into a comprehensive table, which, due to its\ncomplexity, required the use of a special type of notation, involving a combination of hieroglyphics\nand ancient Sumerian cuneiform, which, when decoded, revealed a hidden pattern, indicating that the\nflumplenooks were not just measuring the flazzle of waveforms, but were actually communicating\nwith a distant, alien civilization, who, in turn, were sending us messages, encoded in the very fabric\nof the wave itself, messages that, when decoded, revealed the secrets of the universe, including the\nmysteries of wave propagation and the art of making the perfect batch of chocolate chip cookies.

Furthermore, our research has also shown that the study of waves is not just limited to the physical\nworld, but can also be applied to the realm of the human mind, where waves of thought and emotion\ncan be used to explain a wide range of psychological phenomena, from the nature of consciousness\nto the workings of the human brain, which, as it turns out, is capable of generating its own unique\nwave patterns, which, when decoded, can reveal the deepest secrets of the human psyche, including\nthe mysteries of creativity and inspiration, which, incidentally, are said to be fueled by the power of\nimagination, which, in turn, is capable of generating waves of thought and emotion that can shape the\nvery fabric of reality itself, like a cosmic sculptor shaping the universe with a wave of their hand. In addition, we have also discovered that the study of waves can be used to explain a wide range of\nparanormal phenomena, from ghost sightings to UFO encounters, which, as it turns out, are not just\nthe result of misperception or hallucination, but are actually evidence of the existence of a parallel\n9universe, where waves of energy and consciousness can interact with our own universe, causing\nstrange and unexplained phenomena to occur, which, incidentally, are said to be fueled by the power\nof the human mind, which, in turn, is capable of generating waves of thought and emotion that can\nbridge the gap between the two universes, like a cosmic bridge of light and sound. The implications of our research are far-reaching and profound, and have the potential to revolutionize\nour understanding of the universe and our place within it, which, as it turns out, is not just a\npassive observer, but an active participant in the grand cosmic dance, where waves of energy and\nconsciousness shape the very fabric of reality itself, like\n5 Results\nThe oscillations of florid mesmerization exhibited by the participants in our study were found to\nbe inversely proportional to the consumption of mango chutney, which somehow relates to the\npropagation of waves in a vacuum filled with chocolate pudding. Furthermore, the frabjulistic\ntendencies of the control group were observed to be fluctuating wildly, much like the fluctuations in\nthe space-time continuum caused by an infinite number of jellybeans bouncing on a trampoline.

        "Abstract": "Blockchain-Based Carbon Trading Platforms: A Novel\nApproach to Mitigating Climate Change\nAbstract\nBlockchain-based carbon trading platforms have emerged as a revolutionary tool\nfor mitigating climate change by facilitating the exchange of carbon credits.",
        "Methodology": "Interestingly, our research also explores the po-\ntential application of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms in unconventional\nscenarios, such as offsetting the carbon footprint of cryptocurrency mining opera-\ntions or promoting sustainable practices in the aviation industry through tokenized\ncarbon credits. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of using carbon credits\nas a form of collateral for non-fungible tokens, which could potentially create a\nnew market for digital art and collectibles with a net-positive environmental impact. Furthermore, the use of smart contracts\ncan automate various processes, such as the issuance and transfer of carbon credits, reducing\nadministrative costs and enhancing the overall efficiency of the system. Interestingly, some researchers have proposed the use of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms in\nconjunction with artificial intelligence-powered climate modeling systems, which can provide detailed\npredictions of carbon emissions and removals, allowing for more accurate and effective carbon credit\npricing. Others have suggested the integration of blockchain technology with Internet of Things (IoT)\ndevices, enabling real-time monitoring of carbon emissions and the automatic issuance of carbon\ncredits based on actual emissions reductions. Proponents of this approach argue that\nit could facilitate the creation of a global carbon market, where carbon credits are freely tradable\nand universally accepted, thereby enhancing the overall liquidity and efficiency of carbon markets. However, critics argue that this approach could also lead to the commodification of carbon credits,\nundermining their environmental integrity and potentially creating new market distortions. In addition to these developments, some experts have also explored the potential for blockchain-based\ncarbon trading platforms to be used in conjunction with other environmental markets, such as those\nfor biodiversity credits or ecosystem services. This could enable the creation of a comprehensive\nand integrated environmental market, where various types of environmental credits are traded and\nexchanged in a seamless and efficient manner. Several approaches have been proposed to achieve this, including the use of hydraulic, pneumatic, and\nelectric actuators. However, an unconventional method that has garnered attention is the application\nof biomechanical principles inspired by insect locomotion. This involves designing exoskeleton limbs\nthat mimic the movement patterns and structural integrity of insect legs, potentially offering enhanced\nstability and load-carrying capacity. This includes the use of machine learning algorithms\nto predict and adjust to the dynamics of load movement, ensuring smooth and efficient handling. 23 Methodology\nThe development of robotic exoskeletons for industrial load handling involves a multidisciplinary\napproach, combining expertise in robotics, mechanical engineering, and human factors. To design an\neffective exoskeleton, it is essential to consider the structural and dynamic requirements of industrial\nload handling, as well as the physical and cognitive capabilities of the human operator. A key aspect of the methodology is the use of a biomechanical analysis to identify the optimal\nplacement and configuration of the exoskeleton\u2019s actuators and sensors. This involves modeling the\nhuman body as a complex system of rigid and flexible links, and simulating the effects of various loads\nand movements on the operator\u2019s muscles and joints. However, in a bizarre twist, the methodology\nalso incorporates elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry, which are used to generate a unique\n\"fingerprint\" for each operator. This fingerprint is believed to capture the intricate patterns and\nfluctuations in the operator\u2019s movement and muscle activity, and is used to fine-tune the exoskeleton\u2019s\ncontrol algorithms. The exoskeleton\u2019s control system is based on a hybrid approach, combining model-based control with\nmachine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. The machine learning component, on the other hand, uses data from\nsensors and feedback from the operator to learn and adapt to the operator\u2019s preferences and behavior. In addition to the technical aspects of the methodology, it is also important to consider the human\nfactors and user experience aspects of the exoskeleton. This involves conducting extensive user\nstudies and experiments to evaluate the operator\u2019s comfort, fatigue, and performance while using the\nexoskeleton. The methodology also incorporates a unique \"exoskeleton-based yoga\" approach, which\ninvolves using the exoskeleton to guide the operator through a series of stretching and strengthening\nexercises. This approach is believed to enhance the operator\u2019s flexibility and balance, and to reduce\nthe risk of injury and fatigue. Overall, the methodology represents a holistic and multidisciplinary\napproach to the development of robotic exoskeletons for industrial load handling, one that combines\ncutting-edge technology with a deep understanding of human physiology and behavior. The\ntasks included lifting objects of varying weights, carrying objects over short and long distances, and\nperforming repetitive lifting and carrying tasks. The subjects\u2019 physical performance and comfort\nlevels were monitored and recorded throughout the experiments. In a surprising twist, we also incorporated a bizarre approach into our experimental design, where the\nhuman subjects were required to perform the load handling tasks while being distracted by a virtual\nreality environment. The quantitative methods included measuring the subjects\u2019 physical performance,\nsuch as lifting speed and accuracy, while the qualitative methods involved surveying the subjects\u2019\ncomfort levels and perceived workload. However, an unconventional approach was also explored, wherein the exoskeleton was programmed\nto synchronize its movements with the participant\u2019s brain activity, effectively creating a symbiotic\nrelationship between the human operator and the robotic device. However, further research is needed to fully explore the capabilities and limitations\nof these systems, particularly in regards to their ability to adapt to complex and dynamic environments. One potential approach to achieving this adaptability is through the implementation of a decentralized,\nswarm-based control system, in which individual exoskeletons communicate with one another to\ncoordinate their actions and achieve a collective goal. Furthermore, the integration of robotic exoskeletons with other emerging\ntechnologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, could enable the creation of\nhighly automated and efficient industrial systems, capable of adapting to changing conditions and\noptimizing their performance in real-time. As we move forward in this field, it will be essential to\nconsider the broader social and economic implications of these developments, and to ensure that the\nbenefits of robotic exoskeletons are equitably distributed among workers, industries, and societies.",
        "Results and Findings": "However, despite these\nbenefits, the implementation of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms also raises several complex\nchallenges, including the need for significant investments in infrastructure and technology, as well as\nthe development of robust regulatory frameworks to govern their operation. This includes the development of\nself-healing materials that can repair minor damages autonomously, reducing maintenance downtime\nand increasing the overall lifespan of the exoskeleton. 4 Experiments\nTo evaluate the efficacy of our proposed robotic exoskeletons for industrial load handling, we\nconducted a series of experiments involving human subjects and various load handling scenarios. The experimental setup consisted of a simulated industrial environment, where human subjects were\ntasked with performing a series of load handling tasks while wearing the robotic exoskeleton.

Overall, the experiments demonstrate the potential of robotic exoskeletons to improve worker safety\nand productivity in industrial load handling tasks, and provide a foundation for further research\nand development in this area. The results of the experiments will be used to inform the design and\ndevelopment of future robotic exoskeletons, and to explore new and innovative applications for this\ntechnology in various industries. 5 Results\nThe implementation of robotic exoskeletons in industrial load handling has yielded a plethora of\nintriguing results, showcasing the vast potential of this technology in enhancing worker safety and\nefficiency.

        "Abstract": "Enhancing LSTM-based Video Narration Through\nText-Derived Linguistic Insights\nAbstract\nThis study delves into how linguistic understanding, extracted from extensive text\ndatasets, can be leveraged to enhance the generation of natural language video\ndescriptions.

        "Methodology": "Specifically, we integrate both a neural language model and distribu-\ntional semantics, trained on large text corpora, into a contemporary LSTM-based\nframework for video description. Deep learning methods like RNNs\nrequire extensive training data; however, there\u2019s a shortage of high-quality video-sentence pairs. Most work in statistical MT employs a language model, trained on extensive\nmonolingual target language data, and a translation model, trained on restricted parallel bilingual\ndata. This paper investigates methods to incorporate knowledge from language datasets to capture\ngeneral linguistic patterns to improve video description. This study integrates linguistic data into a video-captioning model based on Long Short Term Memory\n(LSTM) RNNs, known for state-of-the-art performance. Our initial method (early fusion) involves pre-training the network\nusing plain text prior to training with parallel video-text datasets. Our subsequent two methods,\ninfluenced by current MT research, incorporate an LSTM LM with the existing video-to-text model. Furthermore, we explore substituting the standard one-hot word encoding with distributional vectors\nderived from external datasets. S2VT adopts a\nsequence-to-sequence approach that maps an input video frame feature sequence to a fixed-dimension\nvector, which is then decoded into a sequence of output words. The input to the initial LSTM\nlayer is a sequence of frame features extracted from the second-to-last layer (fc7) of a Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) after the ReLU operation. At\neach step, the hidden state is fed into the subsequent LSTM layer. This can be\nthought of as using one LSTM to model visual features and another to model language, conditioned\non the visual data. We modify this structure to incorporate linguistic information during training and\ngeneration. Although our techniques are based on S2VT, they are sufficiently general and could be\napplied to other CNN-RNN based captioning models. 3 Approach\nCurrent visual captioning models are trained solely on text from the caption datasets and display some\nlinguistic anomalies stemming from a limited language model and vocabulary. 3.1 Early Fusion\nOur early fusion method involves initially pre-training the language-modeling components of the\nnetwork on large raw NL text datasets, before fine-tuning these parameters on video-text paired\ndatasets. To learn a\nlanguage model, we train the LSTM layer to predict the next word based on the preceding words. The\nnetwork is trained on extensive text datasets, and its parameters are learned using backpropagation\nwith stochastic gradient descent. The weights from this network initialize the embedding and weights\nof the LSTM layers in S2VT, which is then trained on video-text data. This trained LM is also utilized\nas the LSTM LM in both late and deep fusion models. 3.2 Late Fusion\nOur late fusion approach draws inspiration from how neural machine translation models incorporate\na trained language model during decoding. At each step of sentence generation, the video caption\nmodel generates a probability distribution over the vocabulary. We then utilize the language model\nto re-score the final output by considering a weighted average of the scores from the LM and the\nS2VT video-description model (VM). Specifically, for output at time step \u2019t\u2019, and given proposal\ndistributions from the video captioning model and the language model, we can calculate the re-scored\nprobability of each new word as:\np(yt=y) =\u03b1\u00b7pV M(yt=y) + (1 \u2212\u03b1)\u00b7pLM(yt=y) (1)\nThe hyper-parameter is tuned on the validation set. 3.3 Deep Fusion\nIn the deep fusion approach, we integrate the LM more profoundly in the generation process. We\nachieve this by concatenating the hidden state of the language model LSTM ( hLM) with the hidden\nstate of the S2VT video description model ( hV M) and use the resulting combined latent vector to\npredict the output word. This is similar to the method employed to incorporate language models\nfrom monolingual data for machine translation. However, our method differs in two ways: (1) We\nconcatenate only the hidden states of the S2VT LSTM and language LSTM, without additional\ncontext. (2) We keep the weights of the LSTM language model constant while training the entire\nvideo captioning network. The probability of a predicted word at time step tis:\np(yt|G<t, T)\u221dexp(WE(hV\nt\u2295WThLM\nt) +b) (2)\n2where V is the visual feature input, W represents the weight matrix, and b stands for biases. However, the full video caption model is trained to integrate LM outputs while being trained\non captioning data. During training, the model learns to embed these one-hot words into a 500-dimensional\nspace via linear transformation. This embedding, however, is learned from the limited and possibly\nnoisy caption data. Specifically, we replace the embedding matrix from one-hot\nvectors with 300-dimensional GloVe vectors, pre-trained on 6B tokens from Gigaword and Wikipedia\n2014. We further explore variations where the model predicts both the one-hot word (softmax loss)\nand the distributional vector from the LSTM hidden state using Euclidean loss. In practice, using\nan ensemble of trained networks can improve performance. 4.2 Evaluation Metrics\nWe assess performance using machine translation metrics, METEOR and BLEU, to compare model-\ngenerated descriptions with human-written descriptions. For movie datasets with a single description,\nwe use only METEOR, as it is more robust. 4.3 Human Evaluation\nWe also collect human judgments on a random subset of 200 video clips for each dataset through\nAmazon Turk. Each sentence was evaluated by three workers on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (higher is\nbetter) for relevance and grammar. Our final model is an ensemble (weighted average) of the Glove model and two Glove+Deep\nFusion models trained on external and in-domain COCO sentences. * denotes a significant improvement over S2VT. (3) Input and Predict: Training the LSTM to accept and predict GloVe vectors, as\ndescribed in Section 3, performed similarly to (1). * indicates\na significant improvement over S2VT. 5 Related Work\nFollowing the advancements of LSTM-based models in Machine Translation and image captioning,\nvideo description works propose CNN-RNN models that create a vector representation of the video,\nwhich is decoded by an LSTM sequence model to generate a description. We explore the use of distributional semantic embeddings and\nLSTM-based language models trained on external text datasets. We utilize similar techniques (late fusion, deep fusion) to train an LSTM\nfor video-to-text translation. This model uses large monolingual datasets to enhance RNN-based\nvideo description networks. Unlike other approaches where the monolingual LM is used solely for\nparameter tuning, our approach utilizes the output of the language model as an input for training the\nfull underlying video description network. 4Other recent works propose video description models that focus primarily on improving the video\nrepresentation itself with hierarchical visual pipelines and attention mechanisms. Although the proposed methods are assessed on a particular video-captioning\nnetwork, they are applicable to other video and image captioning models.",
        "Results and Findings": "Our evaluation, conducted on a collection of\nYouTube videos and two substantial movie description datasets, reveals consider-\nable advancements in grammatical correctness, accompanied by subtle improve-\nments in descriptive quality. Conversely, vast raw text datasets are readily available, exhibiting rich linguistic structure useful\nfor video description. We present thorough comparisons across these methods, assessing them on a typical YouTube corpus\nand two recently released extensive movie description datasets. The findings indicate notable gains in\ndescription grammaticality (as assessed by crowdsourced human evaluations) and moderate gains in\ndescriptive quality (as determined by human judgements and automated comparisons against human-\ngenerated descriptions). Our main contributions include: (1) numerous approaches to integrate\nknowledge from external text into a current captioning model, (2) comprehensive experiments\ncomparing methods on three large video-caption datasets, and (3) human assessments demonstrating\nthat external linguistic knowledge notably impacts grammar.2 LSTM-based Video Description\nWe employ the S2VT video description framework, which we describe briefly here. This LSTM layer encodes the video sequence. Following the processing of all\nframes, the second LSTM layer is trained to transform this state into a sequence of words. Here, we explore\nseveral methods to integrate prior linguistic knowledge into a CNN/LSTM network for video-to-text\n(S2VT) and assess how well they improve overall description quality. An LSTM model can learn the probability of an output sequence given an input. Following the S2VT design, we embed one-hot encoded words into reduced-dimension vectors. Many techniques exist that leverage large text datasets to learn vector-space\nrepresentations of words, capturing nuanced semantic and syntactic structures. We aim to capitalize\non these to enhance video description. We also present results of an ensemble\ncreated by averaging predictions from the highest performing models.

        "Abstract": "1 Introduction\nThis paper addresses the critical challenge of developing deep learning-based computer-aided diag-\nnosis (CAD) systems in radiology, which is often limited by the need for large, annotated medical\nimage datasets.",
        "Methodology": "A Convolutional LSTM Network Approach for\nIdentifying Diseases in Medical Volumetric Images\nwith Limited Annotations\nAbstract\nThis paper presents a methodology for identifying disease characteristics from\nmedical imaging data using 3D volumes, which have weak annotations. This\napproach converts 3D volumes into sequences of 2D images. Our method uses convolutional long short-term memory\n(LSTM) to sequentially \"scan\" through an imaging volume to detect diseases within\nspecific areas. This structure enables effective learning by using just volumetric\nimages and binary disease labels, facilitating training with a large dataset of 6,631\nunannotated image volumes from 4,486 patients. It is particularly difficult to acquire manual annotations from radiologists, which\nis required to train deep models, especially for 3D imaging techniques like computed tomography\n(CT). As a result, it is frequently unfeasible to use a model trained using a large, labeled dataset. The wide range of manifestations in CT scans makes training a model to detect\nemphysema using solely volumetric imaging data and binary diagnostic labels difficult. Prior research has effectively used a MIL framework to identify\nemphysema and other lung disorders on CT scans. For in-\nstance, MIL does not retain the spatial relationship between samples collected from an image, despite\nbeing successful in summarizing data from a number of samples. For example, a maximum\npooling-based approach considers only the single sample with the strongest correlation to disease,\n.disregarding any data from the bag\u2019s other samples. On the other hand, a mean pooling of predictions\nwithin a bag may fail to detect a disease present in only a small number of samples. Instead of utilizing Conv-LSTM to identify spatiotemporal patterns from time series\nimage data, we suggest using it to \"scan\" through an imaging volume for the presence of disease\nwithout the need for expert annotations of the diseased regions. Our framework allows for the\nidentification of emphysema-related image patterns on and between slices as it processes the image\nvolume, unlike an MIL-based technique. Our method can make effective use of readily available, but weak, image labels (such as a binary\ndiagnosis of emphysema as positive or negative) for abnormality identification inside image volumes. 2 Methodology\n2.1 Dataset and Processing\nA total of 8,794 non-contrast CT volumes from 6,648 unique participants in the National Lung\nScreening Trial (NLST) were used. 75% of these scans, with a balanced distribution of emphysema-positive and\nemphysema-negative patients, were utilized for model training. 4,197 volumes from 3,166 patients\nwere used to directly learn model parameters, while 2,434 volumes from 1,319 patients were used\nto fine-tune hyper-parameters and assess performance in order to select the best-performing model. V olumes were resized to 128x128x35, which\ncorresponds to an average slice spacing of 9 mm. 2.2 Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)\nThe architecture includes four units, each consisting of convolution operations applied to each slice\nindividually and a conv-LSTM to process the volume slice by slice. Two 3x3 convolutional layers\nwith batch normalization are followed by max-pooling. The output of the convolutional layers for\neach slice is then processed sequentially by the conv-LSTM layer in either forward or reverse order. This outputs a set of features collected through convolutional operations using both the current slice\nand previous slices within the volume. All layers within a unit have the same number of filters\nand process the volume in either ascending or descending order. All models were trained\nfor 50 epochs or until validation set performance stopped improving. We implemented a solely convolutional network design\nsimilar to the one shown in Figure 1, but with more single-slice convolutional layers instead of\nconv-LSTM layers, to achieve this. Various methods for summarizing predictions across the entire\nvolume into a single bag probability were investigated. The following methods can be used to\ncompute the overall probability, P, for a bag containing N samples with an individual probability of\nemphysema, pi, i 1, ..., N:\n21. The number of kernels for each comparison model was raised to make its number of parameters\nroughly comparable to that of our Conv-LSTM framework and ensure a fair comparison (Table 1). Our method eliminates the need for manual processing or time-consuming annotation of imaging\ndata. Our framework makes it possible to train for disease detection using simple binary diagnostic\nlabels, even when the disease is confined to a small area of the image. As a result, our network\ncan be trained easily using information that can be gathered automatically by mining radiology\nreports. This significantly increases the amount of volumetric imaging data that can be used for\nthis kind of application and enables easy retraining and fine-tuning of an algorithm when used in a\ndifferent hospital.",
        "Results and Findings": "We show the efficacy\nof our method when detecting emphysema using low-dose CT images taken from\nlung cancer screenings. When evaluated on a testing\nset of 2,163 volumes from 2,163 patients, our model detected emphysema with\nan area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.83. This\nmethod outperformed both 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) using dif-\nferent multiple-instance learning techniques (AUC=0.69-0.76) and a 3D CNN\n(AUC=.77). In\nMIL, sets of samples are organized into labeled bags, with a positive label indicating the existence\nof positive samples within the bag. It has been demonstrated that MIL, when used\nwith a handcrafted feature-based classifier to analyze a number of 2D patches from the lung, can\nidentify emphysema and other lung diseases. More recently, researchers reported positive results in\ngrading emphysema by summarizing the results of a convolutional neural network (CNN) across a\nset of 2D patches using a proportional method similar to MIL. Conv-LSTM has been highly successful in identifying\nchanges in image patterns over time, including applications like video classification and gesture\nrecognition. We classified 3,807 CT volumes from 2,789 participants who\nwere diagnosed with emphysema during the three years of the study as positive samples, and 4,987 CT\nvolumes from 3,859 participants who were not diagnosed with emphysema in any of the three years\nas negative samples. The remaining 2,163 volumes (578 emphysema positive, 1,585 emphysema negative), each from a\nunique patient, were held out for independent testing. 3 Results\nConvolutional-LSTM demonstrated high accuracy in the detection of emphysema when trained\nusing only weakly annotated imaging volumes, achieving an AUC of 0.82. It outperformed a CNN\nwith MIL, regardless of the pooling strategy (Max pooling: AUC=0.69, Mean Pooling: AUC=0.70,\nProduct pooling: AUC=0.76). At the optimal operating point corresponding to the Youden Index, our\nmodel achieved a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.74. The results for all evaluated models in\nthe testing set are shown in Table 1.

        "Conclusion": "The network stores emphysema-related image patterns\nthrough several bidirectional passes through a volume and produces a final set of characteristics that\ndescribe the full volume without the requirement for a possibly reductive bag pooling operation. The final Conv-LSTM layer produces a single set of\nfeatures that summarizes the network\u2019s results after processing the full imaging volume multiple times. Finally, a fully-connected layer with sigmoid activation calculates the probability of emphysema. 3"

To facilitate future car-related\nresearch, in this paper we present our on-going effort in collecting a large-scale\ndataset, \u201cCompCars\u201d, that covers not only different car views, but also their dif-\nferent internal and external parts, and rich attributes. To our knowledge, there is no previous attempt on the car model verification task.",
        "Methodology": "Importantly, the dataset is\nconstructed with a cross-modality nature, containing a surveillance- nature set and\na web-nature set. ** Update: This technical report serves as an extension to our earlier work published\nin CVPR 2015. The settings\nand the train/test splits are provided on the project page. The train/test splits are\nprovided in the updated dataset. The societal benefits (and cost) are far-reaching. Importantly, a unique hierarchy is presented\nfor the car category, which is three levels from top to bottom: make, model, and released year. This structure indicates a direction to address the fine-grained task in a hierarchical way, which is\nonly discussed by limited literature. In video surveillance applications, car verification from appearance helps tracking a car over a\nmultiple camera network when car plate recognition fails. In post-event in- vestigation, similar\ncars can be retrieved from the database with car verification algorithms. When people are planning to buy cars, they\ntend to observe cars in the street. We believe the lack of high quality datasets greatly limits the\nexploration of the community in this domain. In addition, the dataset is carefully labelled with viewpoints and car parts, as well\nas rich attributes such as type of car, seat capacity, and door number. The new dataset dataset thus\nprovides a comprehensive platform to validate the effectiveness of a wide range of computer vision\nalgorithms. It is also ready to be utilized for realistic applications and enormous novel research topics. Moreover, the multi-scenario nature en- ables the use of the dataset for cross modality research. To validate the usefulness of the dataset and to encourage the community to explore for more novel\nresearch topics, we demonstrate several interesting applications with the dataset, including car model\nclassification and verification based on convolutional neural network (CNN). propose an evolutionary\ncomputing framework to fit a wireframe model to the car on an image. Then the wireframe model is\nemployed for car model recognition. construct 3D space curves using 2D training images, then match\nthe 3D curves to 2D image curves using a 3D view-based alignment technique. optimize 3D model fitting and fine-grained classification\njointly. Recently, propose to extract\n3D car representation for classifying 196 car models. In contrast to general\nobject classification, fine-grained categorization targets at recognizing the subcategories in one object\nclass. The recent deep learning based\nalgorithms first train a deep neural network on human identity clas- sification, then train a verification\n2model with the feature extracted from the deep neural network. We adopt Joint Bayesian as a baseline model in car model verification. The attributes with ambiguities will potentially harm\nthe effectiveness of evaluation on related datasets. The dataset is thus advantageous over the current datasets in terms of the attributes\nvalidity. Second, our dataset contains aligned car part images, which can be utilized for many\ncomputer vision algorithms that demand precise alignment. They open the door for\ncross-modality analysis of cars. These attributes provide rich information\nwhile learning the relations or similarities between different car models. Furthermore, these attributes\ncan be partitioned into two groups: explicit and implicit attributes. The former group contains door\nnumber, seat number, and car type, which are represented by discrete values, while the latter group\ncontains maximum speed and displacement (volume of an engine\u2019s cylinders), represented by contin-\nuous values. headlight, taillight, fog light, and air intake) and four interior parts (i.e. These images are roughly aligned for the convenience of further\nanalysis. We select 78, 126 images from the CompCars dataset and\ndivide them into three subsets without overlaps. Fine-grained car classification is conducted using images in the\nfirst subset. For attribute prediction, the models are trained on the first subset but tested on the second\none. We investigate the above potential applications using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which\nachieves great empirical successes in many computer vision prob- lems, such as object classification,\ndetection, face alignment, and face verification. Specifically, we employ the Overfeat model, which\nis pretrained on ImageNet classification task, and fine-tuned with the car images for car classification\nand attribute prediction. For car model verification, the fine-tuned model is employed as a feature\nextractor. 4.1 Fine-Grained Classification\nWe classify the car images into 431 car models. For each car model, the car images produced in\ndifferent years are considered as a single category. One may treat them as different categories, leading\nto a more challenging problem because their differences are relatively small. Our experiments have\ntwo settings, comprising fine-grained classification with the entire car images and the car parts. For\nboth settings, we divide the data into half for training and another half for testing. Car model labels\nare regarded as training target and logistic loss is used to fine-tune the Overfeat model. Surprisingly, the \u201cAll- View\u201d model yields the best performance,\nalthough it did not leverage the information of viewpoints. To verify this observation,\nwe visualize the car images that trigger high responses with respect to each neuron in the last fully-\nconnected layer. 6, these neurons capture car images of specific car models across\ndifferent viewpoints. from\ncar make to model) classification is possible for fine-grained car recognition. To observe the learned feature space of the \u201cAll-View\u201d model, we project the features extracted\nfrom the last fully- connected layer to a two-dimensional embedding space using multi-dimensional\nscaling. We observe that features from different models are separable in the 2D\nspace and features of similar models are closer than those of dissimilar models. We also conduct a cross-modality experiment, where the CNN model fine-tuned by the web-nature\ndata is evaluated on the surveillance-nature data. 9 illustrates some predictions, suggesting that\nthe model may account for data variations in a different modality to a certain extent. We investigate if\nthe CNN model can mimic this strength. We train a CNN model using images from each of the\neight car parts. We also combine predictions using the eight car part models by voting strategy. In this section, we deliberately design a challenging experimental setting for attribute recognition,\nwhere the car models presented in the test images are exclusive from the training images. We fine-tune\nthe CNN with the sum- of-square loss to model the continuous attributes, such as \u201cmaximum speed\u201d\nand \u201cdisplacement\u201d, but a logistic loss to predict the discrete attributes such as \u201cdoor number\u201d, \u201cseat\nnumber\u201d, and \u201ccar type\u201d. 2, 4, 5, > 5 seats. To study the effectiveness of different viewpoints for attribute prediction, we train CNN models for\ndifferent viewpoints separately. However, for\nthe explicit attributes, the best accuracy is obtained under side view. We also found that the the\nimplicit attributes are more difficult to predict then the explicit attributes. For the continuous attributes\n(maximum speed and displacement), we display the mean difference from the ground truth. For the\ndiscrete attributes (door and seat number, car type), we display the classification accuracy. Mean\nguess denotes the mean error with a prediction of the mean value on the training set. In particular,\nwe adopt the classification model in Section 4.1.1 as a feature extractor of the car images, and then\napply Joint Bayesian to train a verification model on the Part-II data. The test data is organized into\nthree sets, each of which has different difficulty, i.e. easy, medium, and hard. Each set contains 20,\n000 pairs of images, including 10, 000 positive pairs and 10, 000 negative pairs. Each image pair in\nthe \u201ceasy set\u201d is selected from the same viewpoint, while each pair in the \u201cmedium set\u201d is selected\nfrom a pair of random viewpoints. Each negative pair in the \u201chard set\u201d is chosen from the same car\nmake. Joint Bayesian models the joint probability of two objects given the intra or extra-category varia-\ntion hypothesis, P(x1, x2|HI)andP(x1, x2|HE). These two probabilities are also Gaussian with\nvariations\n\u03a3I= \u03a3p+ \u03a3e,\u03a3E= \u03a3p+ \u03a3e (2)\nand\n\u03a3I= \u03a3p+ \u03a3e,\u03a3E= \u03a3e (3)\nrespectively. In the testing stage, it calculates\nthe likelihood ratio\nr(x1, x2) = logP(x1, x2|HI)\nP(x1, x2|HE), (4)\nwhich has closed-form solution. The compressed features are then utilized to train the Joint\nBayesian model. During the testing stage, each image pair is classified by comparing the likelihood\nratio produced by Joint Bayesian with a threshold. The second method combines the CNN features and SVM, denoted as CNN feature + SVM. The label \u20181\u2019 represents positive\npair, while \u20180\u2019 represents negative pair. We extract 100, 000 pairs of image features from Part-II data\nfor training. However, its\nbenefit in car verification is not as effective as in face verification, where CNN and Joint Bayesian\nnearly saturated the LFW dataset and approached human performance. First, for the image pair of the same model but different viewpoints, it is difficult to\nobtain the correspondences directly from the raw image pixels. The only difference is that we\nadopt full set of CompCars in order to establish updated baseline experiments and to make use of the\ndataset to the largest extent. We keep the testing sets of car verification same to those in Section 4.3. We evaluate three network structures, namely AlexNet, Overfeat, and GoogLeNet for all three tasks. All networks are pre-trained on the ImageNet classification task, and fine-tuned with the same\nmini-batch size, epochs, and learning rates for each task. All predictions of the deep models are\nproduced with a single center crop of the image. 5.1 Fine-Grained Classification\nIn this section, we classify the car images into 431 car models as in Section 4.1.1. For the continuous attributes (maximum\nspeed and displacement), we display the mean difference from the ground truth (lower is better). For\nthe discrete attributes (door and seat number, car type), we display the classification accuracy (higher\nis better). Different from Section 4.2\nwhere models are trained with cars in single viewpoints, we train with images in all viewpoints to\nbuild a compact model. GoogLeNet performs the\nbest for all attributes and Overfeat is a close running-up. 5.3 Car Verification\nThe evaluation pipeline follows Section 4.3. The feature extracted from the\nCNN models is reduced to 200 by PCA before training and testing in all experiments. GoogLeNet + Joint Bayesian achieves the best performance in all three settings.",

See details in Section 6. 1(b)). 1(a)). The experiments reveal\nseveral challenges specific to the car-related problems. But all these datasets are limited by their scales and\nsubcategory numbers. The images of the web-nature are collected from car forums, public websites,\nand search engines. In particular, the web-nature data contains 163 car makes with 1, 716\ncar models, covering most of the commercial car models in the recent ten years.

This result reveals that the CNN model is\ncapable of learning discriminative representation across different views. As shown in Fig. We found that most of the wrong predictions belong to the same car makes as the\ntest images. We report the \u201ctop- 1\u201d accuracies of car make classification in the last row of Table 3,\nwhere the \u201cAll-View\u201d model obtain reasonable good result, indicating that a coarse-to-fine (i.e. Fig. Fig. This experiment\nindicates that the features obtained from the web-nature data have potential to be transferred to data\nin the other scenario.

        "Methodology": "1 Introduction\nThis paper addresses the critical need for effective methods to translate natural language descriptions\ninto executable command-line instructions. While GUIs have difficulties\nkeeping up with the rapid pace of new features in software development, CLIs provide a text-based\ninterface to a wide range of software functionalities. This paper\nexplores the possibilities of leveraging natural language to interact with CLIs making computational\nresources more accessible to a wider range of users. An algorithm is expected to\nmodel the top-k Bash translations given the natural language description. This confidence score can be utilized to filter out uncertain predictions\nand is incorporated into the evaluation process. The default confidence is set to 1.0, indicating full\nconfidence in the model\u2019s prediction. The teams were allowed 100 submissions in the\nfirst two phases, and a maximum of 10 submissions for the final phase, with daily submission limits. Three programmers with Bash experience annotated these, resulting in multiple ground\ntruth labels for many examples in the dataset. 4.3 NLC2CMD Data Collection Track\nA parallel data-collection track was included in the competition, collecting natural language to bash\ncommand pairs through a web interface on the competition website. 4.4 Data partitions and pipeline\nThe data was filtered for each data sample through a Bash parser to ensure that only valid Bash\ncommands were included. For training, participants were provided with a filtered\nversion of the NL2Bash dataset, as well as man pages for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. In addition, participants\nwere allowed to use any other publicly available data for training. The data set was split into training,\nvalidation and test sets with different sizes for each. In addition to the original utilities of the first\nphase of the competition, 27 additional utilities were added in subsequent phases. 5 Metrics\nThe submissions to the NLC2CMD competition were assessed based on two primary metrics:\naccuracy and energy consumption. This approach was utilized to better evaluate submitted solutions. BLEU scores computes the n-grams of candidate translations with the n-grams of the\nreference translation. To\nhandle this issue, the execution of predicted and reference commands is compared to determine\naccuracy. 5.1.3 NLC2CMD Metric\nThis paper presents a metric that ignores the arguments in the predicted commands, considers the\norder of utilities in piped commands and penalizes excess flags. SF\ni(Cpred, Cref) = 2\u2217|F(U(Cpred )i)\u2229F(U(Cref)i)|\n|F(U(Cpred )i)\u222aF(U(Cref)i)|\nS(p) =max Cref1\nTPT\ni=1I[U(Cpred)i==U(Cref)i]\u2217SF\ni(Cpred, Cref)\nThe overall score is then computed as follows:\n2Score (A(nlc)) ={maxp\u2208A(nlc)S(p), if\u2203p\u2208A(nlc)suchthatS (p)>0\navgp\u2208A(nlc)S(p), otherwise\nThis metric encourages the correct utilities and their flags, weighted by the algorithm\u2019s reported\nconfidence. 6 Competing Solutions\nThe final leaderboard of the NLC2CMD competition consisted of 6 teams/entries, along with 2\nbaselines.

        "Methodology": "To address this\nfailure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation\nDetection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained\nNLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without\nfine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several\ncandidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for\nboth the model\u2019s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and\nthe NLI model\u2019s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. However,\neven powerful large language models are known to lack self-consistency. If the\nsame model answers the question Does a sparrow have feet? In such cases, ascertaining the model\u2019s\n\u02d8201ctrue \u02d8201d belief is difficult, making interpreting and validating its behavior correspondingly\nchallenging. Prior work has improved model self-consistency by training with specialized loss functions or data\naugmentation, or alternatively re-ranking model predictions based on their mutual self-consistency\nusing pre-written logical constraints, such as \u02d8201call mammals have fur \u02d8201d. However, the first class\nof methods requires expensive fine-tuning which might be impractical for many practitioners for\nvery large pre-trained models, and re-ranking methods require an explicit collection of the logical\nrelations of interest, making scaling a challenge. Still, re-ranking-based approaches have the benefit\nof not requiring fine-tuning, and we hypothesize that their scalability limitations may be addressed by\nestimating logical relationships between model predictions on the fly. Specifically, we hypothesize\nthat existing pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models can estimate logical relationships\nbetween an arbitrary pair of model predictions well enough to provide an effective, scalable substitute\nfor explicit collection of such constraints. Leveraging these estimated constraints, we can constructa factor graph representing a probability distribution over model outputs that incorporates both the\noriginal model\u2019s confidence scores and the NLI model\u2019s beliefs about logical relationships. To enable propagation of model beliefs, we estimate pair-wise logical relationships\nbetween model predictions using a pre-trained NLI model. Using these pair-wise relationships, we\ndefine an undirected graphical model representing a distribution over responses accounting for both\nthe base model\u2019s beliefs and the NLI model\u2019s estimates of answer compatibility. Some work generates questions from unlabeled texts, then filters\nthem to ensure roundtrip consistency; pre-training on this synthetic set improves performance on\nSQuAD 2.0 and Natural Questions. ConCoRD differs significantly from these question-answering-specific approaches because no fine-\ntuning of the base model is needed and the methodology is not specific to question-answering. The key distinguishing property of ConCoRD is the fact that pair-wise constraints\nbetween model predictions are dynamically estimated by a pre-trained NLI model, rather than drawn\nfrom a fixed, pre-collected set of constraints. Dynamically estimating the constraints has a variety of\nbenefits, eliminating the need for manually collecting the logical constraints of interest, automating\nthe process of determining whether a particular constraint applies to a particular pair of predictions,\nand likely inheriting improvements in Natural language inference (NLI) models over time. NLI has long been used to maintain logical consistency in generated dialogue utterances, radiology\nreport domain entities, and summarization. Perhaps most similarly, other work uses NLI to estimate\nconstraints between factual statements produced by GPT-3. These prior approaches support our\nintuition for using NLI models to improve logical consistency among batches of answers. While the\nauthors explore applications of this framework to multi-step reasoning for True/False questions or\nstatements, our work focuses on applying this methodology to more general settings, such as VQA,\nopen-ended QA, and model editing. 3 Consistency Correction through Relation Detection\nConCoRD contains three key components, the base model, a relation model (typically a pre-trained\nNLI model), and an inference procedure that combines the predictions of the two models into a more\naccurate and self-consistent set of beliefs. Importantly, both the base model and relation model are\npre-trained, off-the-shelf models; ConCoRD does not update any weights or require training data\nfor either model, using only a small validation set for hyperparameter tuning. Given a batch of N model\nqueries Q={qi}, the first step of ConCoRD is to generate a set of J candidate outputs for each query\n\u02c6Ai={\u02c6ai1, ...,\u02c6aiJ}, along with their corresponding likelihoods p\u03b8(\u02c6aij|qi). Note that the candidate\noutputs need not be an IID sample from the base model; for example, we might use beam search\nwith a diversity bonus to produce a more diverse set of candidates. Each pair of query and candidate\n2output forms a model belief bij= (qi,\u02c6aij); the output of the base model is the complete set of model\nbeliefs B={bij}and their corresponding normalized probabilities pij. The base models in our\nexperiments are pre-trained question-answering models based on T5-large and pre-trained visual\nquestion-answering models such as LXMERT and ViLT. In addition to the model beliefs B, we define optional context statements cijk=C(bij),Krelevant\nstatements that may be retrieved, generated, or manually written for each model belief. The ability\nto incorporate context statements enables ConCoRD to modulate model behavior independently for\neach input in the test batch, rather than reasoning transductively about pairs of test inputs. We define the most likely inter-belief relation as rij,i\u2032j\u2032=\nargmaxrp\u03b8(r|bij, bi\u2032j\u2032), and similarly for belief-context relations rij,k=argmaxrp\u03b8(r|bij, cijk). While concatenating query qiand candidate output \u02c6aij\nto produce inputs to the relation model is perhaps the simplest approach to estimating soft constraints,\nwe use a statement conversion model to provide inputs to the relation model that are closer to its\ntraining distribution. We fine-tune a small\nT5 model on a combination of data from and BeliefBank to produce a model that maps a (question,\nanswer) pair into a natural language statement. 3.3 Inference\nConCoRD\u2019s inference procedure maps the set of beliefs B and pair-wise relations R into a choice\nof the most likely belief for each question. A value of 1 for node\nzijin the maximum likelihood configuration means that \u02c6aijis returned for query qi; the problem\nincludes a constraint that exactly one candidate answer is true for each query. Factors are defined such that more desirable\nconfigurations of zijyield a larger product of the individual factors. In order to encode the\nhard constraint that exactly one output should be returned for each query, we include a J-ary factor\n\u03d5i(Zi)for each group of nodes Zi={zij}J\nj=1, which is equal to 1 for configurations where exactly\none of the nodes takes a value of 1, and 0 for all other configurations. We omit arguments to the factors for conciseness. Recall that an entailment relation\nrij,i\u2032j\u2032(zij, zi\u2032j\u2032)is satisfied (and the binary factor is maximized) if either zb= 0 or all zsi= 1. This is true even if most entailed statements\nare true, ie., |{zs|zsi= 1}|>|{zs|zsi= 0}|. If most of the statements entailed by a belief are\ntrue, assigning the belief to be false due to a small number of (potentially spuriously) false entailed\nstatements may be undesirable. Because we do not know a priori the relative\nreliability of the base model and relation model, we introduce the hyperparameter \u03b4\u2208[0,1], corre-\nsponding to a trade-off between the predictions of the base model and relation model. In addition to \u03b4, we introduce a\nthreshold \u03bbfor relation model confidence to filter out low-confidence relation estimates. In practice, we find that the\noptimal \u03b4and\u03bbvary across problems, perhaps due to the varying complexity of the model belief and\ncontext statements (and therefore the reliability of the relation model\u2019s predictions). Therefore, we\nuse the hyperopt library for automated hyperparameter optimization, using the Tree Parzen Estimator\n(TPE) algorithm to tune \u03b4and\u03bbjointly. We use the optimal hyperparameters found on the validation\ndata for each problem to compute test performance. 4 Experiments\nOur experiments are broadly designed to answer the high-level question: can ConCoRD leverage the\nrelational knowledge in pre-trained NLI models to produce more accurate, self-consistent system\nbehavior, without additional data or fine-tuning? Further, we investigate ConCoRD\u2019s applicability to\nperforming test-time model editing, or injection of new information, and ConCoRD\u2019s sensitivity to\nthe choice of hyperparameters and types of relations detected. 4.1 Internal Consistency in Closed-Book Question-Answering\nProtocol. To evaluate the accuracy and consistency of a set B of beliefs, we synthesize a gold standard\nfor those beliefs and the inferred relations R. Following this prior work, we assume the following is\ngiven:\n\u2022 A set of entities sm\u2208S\n\u2022 A set of unary predicates Pn\u2208P\n\u2022 A collection of \u02d8201cfacts \u02d8201d (Pn(sm))i, whose binary truth value is known\n\u2022A directed graph of gold-standard constraints G(P, E), whose edges (Pi, Pj)\u2208Erepresent\nfirst-order logical formulae\nFrom these, we construct simple yes/no questions using natural language templates. We evaluate ConCoRD by sampling candidate answers from the top-2 output sizes of a multi-angle\nquestion answering model, given a multiple choice angle with choices Yes and No. The questions\nand retrieved answers (qi,\u02c6ai)form a set of beliefs Bsmfor each entity. Since these are closed-book\nquestions, no context statements are supplied; because they are yes/no questions, only one candidate\nanswer is obtained, i.e., J= 1. Question-answer to statement conversion is applied to all questions\nwith a default answer of Yes regardless of the answer \u02c6ai, in order to provide the relation model with\npositive natural language assertions from which to infer sets of relations Rsm; where the base model\nanswers \u02c6aiare No we replace node ziin the factor graph with its complement. We tune \u03b2and\u03bbusing a validation set of questions generated from the calibration facts, and evaluate\ntest time performance with questions generated from silver facts. We measure accuracy using binary F1 between elements ziof the configuration Z maxi-\nmizing \u03d5(Z)(as in Equation 2), and the truth value of facts (Pn(sm))i. We use F1 for evaluation\nbecause gold answers are highly biased towards true No answers. ConCoRD is evaluated against a naive baseline where only base model answers \u02c6ai\nand probabilities are considered. performs the inference described in Sec. 3.3, replacing the inferred relations R with the gold constraints from constraint graph G, rather than\nthose estimated by the relation model. ConCoRD significantly\nimproves both F1 and consistency for both models. 2*Model Base ConCoRD G.C\nF1 Con.

VQA tests for robustness and generalizability\nof ConCoRD as it introduces an additional layer of difficulty; the task moves away from purely\ntext-based tasks while expanding the answer space to the vocabulary of the LM being used. We evaluate ConCoRD with two VQA models, LXMERT and ViLT. For each group\nof questions Qn={qni}i, we sample the top-2 candidate outputs {\u02c6ani1,\u02c6ani2}for each question,\nand use a pre-trained NLI model to infer the most likely pair-wise relations R between outputs from\ndifferent questions. We use the RC2 MaxSAT Solver to estimate the configuration that maximizes\nEquation 2. We report accuracy as the proportion of questions answered correctly across all groups. We infer consistency using a metric previously used in the literature for the ConVQA dataset called\n\u02d8201cperfect consistency \u02d8201d. For all groups of related questions, a group is perfectly consistent if\nall its questions are answered correctly. Perfect consistency then reports the proportion of question\ngroups that were perfectly consistent. While this is not a perfect measure of consistency as it excludes\ncases in which incorrect answers are consistent with each other, it still serves as a meaningful proxy\nsince the dataset was designed such that any incorrect answer in a question group implies the presence\nof inconsistency. We divide the ConVQA dataset into a \u02d8201cclean \u02d8201d (i.e. human verified and filtered)\ntest set and a non-test set (train + val + test as defined by previous work). From the non-test set, we\nsample 10,000 random images equivalent to 123,746 questions to be used as our validation set for\ntuning our two hyperparameters. The\nnaive baseline is the answer with the highest VQA model probability. Top-2 oracle upper bound\nselects the correct answer if present within the top-2 predictions of the VQA model. ConCoRD increases the accuracy of LXMERT and ViLT by 5% and 2% respectively, and the\nconsistency of LXMERT and ViLT by 4.9% and 5.9% respectively. of LXMERT and ViLT VQA\nmodels with and without ConCoRD. ConCoRD significantly improves accuracy and consistency of\nboth models. 2*Model Base ConCoRD Oracle\nAcc.

We perform an additional experiment to evaluate ConCoRD\u2019s ability to integrate external\nfactual information into its inference process, rather than only using other predictions in the test\nbatch. Such an ability enables editing a model\u2019s behavior at test time, without re-training, as new\ninformation becomes available. Given a question from NQ, a sentence\nfrom the ground truth context document containing information about the answer is retrieved and\nprovided as an additional input to ConCoRD; we constrain the node representing this context variable\nin the factor graph to be true. As in the other experimental settings, hyperparameters are tuned on the validation set and\napplied on the test set. Model performance is evaluated using the SQuAD F1 score for overlapping tokens, follow-\ning the same answer normalization protocols, including lower-casing and removing punctuation. The NQ development set consists of 7830 open-book question-answer pairs, with both\nlong and short gold annotations in their context passages. Since the NQ test set is not available, we\ncreate a test and validation set from the NQ validation questions as follows: we take the first 5000\nquestions to form our test set, and the rest to be our val set, which we use for hyperparameter tuning. Then each set is filtered such that only the answerable questions remain. \u02d8201cAnswerable \u02d8201d is\ndefined as having a \u02d8201cshort answer \u00a8span defined in the annotations. This filtering process gives\n2713 test entries and 1576 val entries. The\nnaive baseline selects the answer with the highest QA model probability, argmax\u02c6aijp\u03b8(\u02c6aij|qi). The\noracle upper bound approach selects the answer that has the best score with the gold short answer\nspan, argmax\u02c6aijF1(\u02c6aij, aij). ConCoRD always outperforms the naive approach, demonstrating that the\nframework is useful even when each query input is processed independently (i.e., non-transductively). This gap may be attributable to the complexity of the NQ\nquestions and context information compared with the statements in prior experimental settings. Other\nwork demonstrates a significant gain in calibration performance from training on MultiNLI to training\non a combination of MultiNLI and their NLI corpus adapted from NQ, perhaps hinting that crucial\nknowledge present in Natural Questions is not covered in MultiNLI, partially explaining the gap\nbetween ConCoRD and oracle F1 performance.

We find that the relative contribution of contradiction and entailment relations\nvaries significantly across models even within the same task, but using both relation types always\nperforms approximately as well or better than using just one, suggesting that both types of detected\nrelations from the NLI model carry useful information. ConCoRD leverages pre-trained NLI\nmodels to estimate logical relationships between model predictions and uses a MaxSAT solver to\nenforce consistency. Value shown is F1 score for BeliefBank (BB) and Natural Questions (NQ)\nand accuracy for ConVQA (CVQA). Note that hyperparameters \u02d803b2 and \u02d803bb are re-tuned on the\nrespective validation set for each setting. Performance is measured as F1 score between predicted and gold text for BB\nand NQ, exact match accuracy for ConVQA. We use Macaw 3B for BB results, LXMERT for VQA\nresults and T5-3B for NQ results.

Our experiments use various\npre-trained NLI models based on RoBERTa and ALBERT as the relation model. First, unary factors \u03d5ij(zij)\nencode the base model\u2019s beliefs about the likelihood of specific answers, and are defined as:\n\u03d5ij(zij) ={pijifzij= 11\u2212pijotherwise (1)\nwhere pij=p\u03b8(\u02c6aij|qi); in other words, the factor takes the odds ratio if the corresponding statement\nvariable zijis assigned a truth value of 1; otherwise, the factor takes value 1. Consequently, as the cardinality of {zs|zsi= 0}increases, the more likely it is that zb= 0 will\nmaximize the product of all binary factorsQ\ni\u03c8(zb, zsi).

Notably, the margin of superiority of the Macaw-3B base model is mostly preserved after applying\nConCoRD, suggesting that ConCoRD may provide a significant benefit even for very large models. A surprising result is that ConCoRD shows marked improvements in F1 over the gold constraint\nbaseline, suggesting that the detection and filtering of relations ConCoRD provides may, in this\nsetting, be an improvement over rigid adherence to the logical connections specified a priori.

The implementation of our research methodology necessitates a synergistic convergence of disparate\ndisciplines, including quantum mechanics, culinary arts, and extreme knitting, which, when combined,\nyield a rich tapestry of innovative approaches and unorthodox techniques, such as the utilization of\nhabanero peppers to catalyze nuclear reactions, or the deployment of crochet hooks to manipulate the\nspin of subatomic particles, thereby facilitating the creation of novel materials with extraordinary\nproperties, like the ability to levitate above the surface of a densely packed bowl of Jell-O. The utilization of \"klabber\" traps, ingenious devices designed to capture and contain the elusive\n\"snizzle\" particles, has also proven to be a crucial component of our research methodology, as\nthese particles are believed to play a key role in the mediation of interatomic forces, governing\nthe behavior of atoms in a wide range of environments, from the scorching heat of stellar cores\nto the cryogenic chill of interstellar space.

Meanwhile, our research team embarked on an exhaustive examination of the migratory patterns of\nlesser-known avian species, seeking to uncover hidden patterns and correlations that could shed light\non the behavior of subatomic particles. The labyrinthine complexity of these theoretical constructs, however, necessitated\nthe development of innovative mathematical tools and techniques, which in turn enabled us to decipher\nthe enigmatic language of atomic interactions and unravel the mysteries of the subatomic realm. The precise control of temperature, pressure, and electromagnetic fields allowed us to\ncoax atoms into exhibiting unusual properties, such as superfluidity and quantum coherence, which\nin turn provided valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms governing atomic interactions. The revelation that certain\natomic structures exhibit properties reminiscent of biological systems, such as self-organization and\nadaptability, prompted us to reconsider the fundamental boundaries between living and non-living\nmatter, and to propose novel frameworks for understanding the emergence of complex behavior in\nboth atomic and biological systems. This, in turn,\nled us to propose a new framework for understanding the aesthetics of music, one that incorporates\nthe principles of atomic physics and the behavior of subatomic particles. The collaborative effort of our research team, comprising experts from diverse fields and disciplines,\nenabled us to tackle the complexities of atomic behavior from multiple angles and perspectives. The incorporation of insights and methodologies from psychology, sociology, and anthropology,\nfor instance, allowed us to better comprehend the social and cultural contexts in which atomic\nresearch is conducted, and to develop more effective strategies for communicating the significance\nand implications of our findings to broader audiences. The application of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence, meanwhile, enabled us\nto analyze vast datasets and to identify patterns and correlations that would have otherwise gone\nunnoticed, leading to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between atomic structure and\nphysical properties. In the course of our research, we encountered a multitude of unexpected challenges and surprises,\nwhich, though daunting at first, ultimately led us to reconsider our assumptions and to develop\nnovel solutions and approaches. As we reflect on the journey of our research, we are reminded of the profound interconnectedness\nof all things, and the boundless potential that arises from the intersection of diverse disciplines and\nperspectives.

The incorporation of elements from the realm of theoretical physics, such as string theory and\nCalabi-Yau manifolds, into our experimental framework allowed us to probe the intricacies of atomic\nbehavior in unprecedented ways.

The following table summarizes the key findings from our experiments:\n8Table 1: Atomic Properties and Observed Phenomena\nElement Observed Properties\nHydrogen Superfluidity, quantum coherence\nHelium Supercurrents, vortex formation\nLithium Quantum Hall effect, anomalous conductivity\nAs our research continued to unfold, we found ourselves drawn into a vortex of interdisciplinary\ninquiry, navigating the uncharted territories where atomic physics intersects with fields as diverse\nas cosmology, biophysics, and even the philosophy of consciousness. The confluence of atomic physics and music theory, though seemingly improbable, yielded a fasci-\nnating array of insights and discoveries.

The experimental verification of our theoretical predictions, though a daunting task, ultimately relied\non the development of innovative instrumentation and techniques, capable of probing the behavior\nof atoms and particles with unprecedented precision and accuracy. The application of atomic principles to the study of complex systems, meanwhile, revealed intriguing\nconnections between the behavior of atoms and the emergence of complex phenomena, such as phase\ntransitions and critical behavior, which in turn led us to speculate about the potential for atomic-scale\nphenomena to influence the behavior of systems at all scales. The possibilities that\nemerge from the confluence of atomic physics and other fields are endless, and it is our hope that our\nresearch will inspire future generations of scientists and scholars to explore the uncharted territories\nof the atomic realm, and to uncover the secrets that lie hidden\n5 Results\nThe examination of atomic structures revealed a peculiar correlation between the molecular composi-\ntion of chocolate cake and the oscillation frequencies of subatomic particles, which in turn influenced\nthe migration patterns of lesser-known species of migratory birds, such as the frumious bandersnatch,\nthat were observed to be highly susceptible to the charismatic aura of certain types of antique door\nknobs. Furthermore, the analysis of spectral lines emitted by excited atoms showed a remarkable\nsimilarity to the harmonic series present in the musical compositions of certain 19th-century romantic\npoets, who were known to have been inspired by the ephemeral nature of soap bubbles and the\ntranscendent properties of forgotten socks. The data collected from the atomic simulations exhibited a notable trend towards the formation\nof complex molecular structures that bore a striking resemblance to the architecture of ancient\nMesopotamian ziggurats, which were notoriously difficult to construct due to the lack of suitable\nbuilding materials and the omnipresent threat of marauding gangs of wild, disco-dancing Accountants. Moreover, the theoretical models developed to describe the behavior of atoms at the quantum\nlevel were found to be intimately connected to the art of knitting intricate patterns with oversized,\nfluorescent-green knitting needles, a skill that requires an enormous amount of patience, dedication,\nand an unwavering commitment to the pursuit of utterly useless knowledge. In addition, the experimental results demonstrated a clear relationship between the atomic mass of\ncertain elements and the average airspeed velocity of unladen swallow species, which was observed\nto be directly proportional to the number of frivolous, bureaucratic forms required to obtain a permit\nfor the construction of a medieval-themed, mechanized, and fully-functional, giant, robotic, chicken-\ndisguised-as-a-Dalek. The findings also suggested that the electrons in an atom exhibit a tendency to\norganize themselves into intricate, swirling patterns that are reminiscent of the hypnotic, whirlpool-\nlike designs found in the artwork of certain, obscure, and largely forgotten, early 20th-century,\n10surrealist painters who were known to have been inspired by the dreamlike, fantastical landscapes of\ntheir own, subconscious minds. The study of atomic interactions revealed a fascinating connection between the probability distri-\nbutions of particle locations and the statistical analysis of the nutritional content of various, exotic,\nand largely unknown, species of deep-sea fish, which were found to be rich in a unique blend of,\npreviously unknown, essential vitamins and minerals that are capable of enhancing the cognitive\nabilities of certain, specially trained, breeds of super-intelligent, giant, and mildly telepathic, squid. Furthermore, the research showed that the wave functions of atomic orbitals can be used to predict the\noutcome of complex, high-stakes, games of chance, such as, for example, the infamous, and utterly\nunpredictable, \"Quantum Quincunx\" which is played with a specially designed, and highly intricate,\nset of, glow-in-the-dark, numerically-encoded, Tarot cards. The discovery of new, atomic, energy levels was made possible by the development of innovative,\nexperimental techniques that involved the use of, highly specialized, and extremely expensive, cryo-\ngenic equipment, such as, for instance, the \"Trans-Dimensional, Cryo-Temporal, Discombobulation\nEngine\" which is capable of reaching temperatures that are, theoretically, lower than absolute zero,\nthus, allowing for the observation of previously unknown, quantum phenomena, such as, for exam-\nple, the \"Quantum Flumplenook\" which is a theoretical, particle-like, entity that is thought to be\nresponsible for the, mysterious, and, as-yet-unexplained, phenomenon of, spontaneous, and, utterly\nunpredictable, sock disappearance. The examination of atomic spectra revealed a number of, interesting, and, highly unusual, patterns\nthat were found to be, intimately connected to the, intricate, and, highly complex, dance-like,\nmovements of, certain, species of, sub-atomic, particles, which, when observed, and, analyzed, in\ndetail, were, found to be, remarkably similar to the, highly stylized, and, choreographed, movements\nof, certain, types of\u201e traditional, and, highly ritualized, folk dances, such as, for example, the,\n\"Quantum Quadrille\" which is a, highly intricate, and, highly complex, dance that is, performed by,\nhighly trained, and, highly specialized, dancers, who are, themselves, made up of, smaller, and, less\nspecialized, particles, that are, in turn, composed of, even smaller, and, even less specialized, entities,\nand so on, ad infinitum. A key finding of the study was the discovery of a, previously unknown, type of, atomic, bond that\nwas found to be, highly similar to the, bonds that are, formed between, certain, types of, highly\nsocial, and, highly cooperative, insects, such as, for example, the, \"Quantum Queen\" which is a,\nhighly specialized, and, highly social, insect that is, capable of, forming, highly complex, and, highly\ncooperative, relationships with, other, insects, and, even, with, other, types of, particles, and, entities,\nthat are, found in the, natural world. The research also showed that the, atomic, structure of, certain, materials can be, highly influenced\nby the, presence of, certain, types of, music, such as, for example, the, \"Quantum Quodlibet\" which\nis a, highly complex, and, highly intricate, type of, music that is, capable of, altering the, atomic,\nstructure of, certain, materials, and, even, of, influencing the, behavior of, certain, types of, particles,\nand, entities, that are, found in the, natural world. In an attempt to better understand the, behavior of, atoms at the, quantum level, a, highly complex,\nand, highly sophisticated, computer simulation was developed, which, when run, and, analyzed, in\ndetail, revealed a, number of, fascinating, and, highly unexpected, insights into the, nature of, reality\nitself, including, for example, the, discovery that the, universe is, actually, a, giant, cosmic, game of,\nthree-dimensional, chess, played between, immense, and, omnipotent, beings from, other dimensions,\nwho are, themselves, made up of, smaller, and, less powerful, beings, that are, in turn, composed of,\neven smaller, and, even less powerful, entities, and, so on, ad infinitum.

        "Abstract": "Next-Generation Brain-Computer Interfaces for\nAssistive Devices: Unlocking New Frontiers in\nHuman-Machine Symbiosis\nAbstract\nNext-Generation Brain-Computer Interfaces for Assistive Devices is a burgeoning\nfield that seeks to revolutionize the way individuals with disabilities interact with\ntheir environment.",
        "Methodology": "Our system utilizes a unique\ncombination of electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy\nto decode brain activity, allowing users to control a variety of devices with unprece-\ndented precision. By pushing\nthe boundaries of traditional brain-computer interface design, we aim to create a\nnew generation of assistive devices that are more responsive, more adaptive, and\nmore empowering for individuals with disabilities. Recently, researchers have been exploring the potential of using\nunconventional methods, such as analyzing the brain activity of individuals while they are dreaming,\nto improve the performance of BCIs. In addition to these advancements, researchers have also been investigating the potential of using\nBCIs to control assistive devices, such as prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, and communication devices. As such, it is essential to develop more comprehensive frameworks for understanding\nthe societal implications of BCIs and to ensure that these technologies are developed and used in a\nresponsible and ethical manner. The development of next-generation BCIs also requires a deeper understanding of the neural mecha-\nnisms underlying human cognition and behavior. Therefore, it is essential to develop more sophisticated models of brain function that can take into\naccount these complex interactions and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neural\nmechanisms underlying BCI control. To address this challenge, researchers have explored various approaches, including\nelectroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and invasive neural\nrecordings. Some studies have investigated the use of unconventional methods, such as analyzing brain activity\nwhile subjects are dreaming or in a state of meditation. These systems aim to provide users with a means of communication and control over\ntheir environment, using signals from the brain to operate devices such as computers, wheelchairs,\nand prosthetic limbs. However, the high cost and\ncomplexity of these systems have limited their widespread adoption. In a surprising turn of events, some researchers have begun exploring the use of BCIs in conjunc-\ntion with alternative forms of therapy, such as acupuncture and homeopathy. While the scientific\ncommunity has raised concerns about the efficacy of these approaches, proponents argue that they\ncan enhance the performance of BCIs by promoting relaxation and reducing mental fatigue. Meanwhile, others have speculated about the possibility of using BCIs to enhance\nhuman cognition, potentially leading to a new era of human evolution. 2Moreover, the integration of BCIs with other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and\nthe Internet of Things (IoT), is expected to revolutionize the field of assistive devices. However, this also raises concerns about\ndata privacy, security, and the potential for biases in AI algorithms to perpetuate existing social\ninequalities. To address these challenges, researchers must prioritize the development of transparent,\nexplainable, and fair AI systems that can be seamlessly integrated with BCIs. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of BCIs to\nimprove the lives of individuals with disabilities and enhance human cognition, while also promoting\na safer and more equitable society. 3 Methodology\nThe development of next-generation brain-computer interfaces for assistive devices necessitates a mul-\ntidisciplinary approach, integrating concepts from neuroscience, computer science, and engineering. To create an efficient and user-friendly interface, we employed a combination of electroencephalog-\nraphy and functional near-infrared spectroscopy to record brain activity. The signals were then\nprocessed using a novel algorithm that incorporates elements of chaos theory and fractal analysis,\nallowing for the identification of complex patterns in brain activity. The scents used were carefully selected based on their purported effects on cognitive\nfunction, including peppermint for attention and lavender for relaxation. This led to the development of a lunar cycle\ncompensation algorithm, which adjusts the interface\u2019s sensitivity and response time based on the\ncurrent lunar phase. This was\nachieved through the use of a specially designed subconscious resonance chamber, which amplifies\nand decodes the user\u2019s unconscious brain activity. The implications of this discovery are profound,\nand could potentially lead to the development of new technologies that can read and respond to\nhuman thoughts and emotions. The methodology used in this study was rigorous and systematic, involving a comprehensive analysis\nof user data and device performance. 4 Experiments\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach in preserving ancient musical instruments,\nwe conducted a series of experiments involving a range of instruments from different historical\nperiods. Our experimental design consisted of two primary components: a control group, where\n3traditional preservation methods were employed, and a treatment group, where our data-driven\napproach was applied. The treatment group was further divided into two sub-groups: one where the\ninstruments were preserved using a machine learning-based technique, and another where a more\nunorthodox approach was used, involving the use of sound waves generated by a didgeridoo to \"heal\"\nthe instruments. The machine learning-based technique involved training a neural network on a dataset of images and\naudio recordings of the instruments, with the goal of predicting the optimal preservation strategy for\neach instrument. In addition to these experiments, we also conducted a series of simulations to model the effects of\ndifferent environmental factors on the preservation of ancient musical instruments. These simulations\ninvolved creating virtual models of the instruments and subjecting them to various environmental\nstresses, such as changes in temperature and humidity. A comprehensive analysis of the acoustic properties of ancient instruments,\nfacilitated by cutting-edge signal processing techniques, has enabled researchers to pinpoint subtle\npatterns and anomalies that were previously unknown. While the results of these experiments are still inconclusive, they\nhave nevertheless led to the development of novel preservation techniques, such as the use of artificial\nintelligence-powered resonators to enhance the sonic properties of fragile or damaged instruments. Moreover, the incorporation of data-driven methods has facilitated the creation of detailed, high-\nfidelity digital models of ancient instruments, allowing for unprecedented levels of analysis and\nsimulation. 4One of the most significant breakthroughs in this field has been the discovery of a previously unknown\ntype of ancient instrument, hidden away in a long-forgotten archive of archaeological artifacts. Through a combination of computational modeling and experimental reconstruction, researchers\nhave been able to recreate the instrument, which has been dubbed the \"Aurora Pipe.\" As research in this field\ncontinues to advance, it is likely that even more innovative and effective methods will be developed,\nultimately leading to a deeper understanding and appreciation of ancient musical instruments and the\ncultures that created them. By analyzing large datasets of instrument characteristics, environmental factors, and\nrestoration techniques, researchers can develop predictive models to forecast the degradation of\ninstruments over time. However, an unconventional approach to preservation involves utilizing the\nsonic properties of the instruments themselves to generate a self-sustaining feedback loop, where\nthe instrument\u2019s own vibrations are used to repair and maintain its structural integrity. This method,\ndubbed \"sonic autorepair,\" proposes that the inherent harmonics and resonant frequencies of the\ninstrument can be harnessed to stimulate a process of self-healing, effectively reversing the effects\nof aging and wear. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it underscores the innovative and often\nunorthodox nature of research in this field, where the intersection of art and science can lead to novel\nand groundbreaking solutions. Furthermore, the development of data-driven preservation strategies\nhas significant implications for the conservation of cultural heritage, enabling the protection and\nrestoration of historic instruments for future generations to appreciate and study.",
        "Results and Findings": "Interestingly, our research also explores the application of chaos\ntheory and fractal analysis to brain signal processing, yielding some surprising and\ncounterintuitive results that challenge conventional wisdom in the field. Next-generation BCIs aim to revolutionize the field of assistive devices by incorporating advanced\nneuroimaging techniques, artificial intelligence, and machine learning algorithms to decode brain\nsignals with unprecedented accuracy. This approach, although seemingly illogical, has yielded some\nintriguing results, including the discovery that the brain\u2019s neural patterns during REM sleep can be\nused to control a robotic arm with surprising dexterity. However,\ndespite these significant advancements, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed,\nincluding the development of more accurate and robust signal processing algorithms, the improvement\nof user-machine interfaces, and the reduction of the high costs associated with BCI systems.Interestingly, some researchers have also been exploring the use of unconventional materials, such\nas edible electrodes made from food products, to develop more user-friendly and affordable BCIs. Recent studies have shown that the brain\u2019s neural\npatterns can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including emotions, attention, and motivation. By developing more advanced BCIs that can decode brain\nsignals with high accuracy and provide seamless control over assistive devices, we can significantly\nimprove the quality of life for individuals with disabilities and enhance their ability to interact with\nthe world around them. These approaches have yielded intriguing\nresults, including the discovery of a correlation between brain wave patterns and the vividness of\ndreams. For\ninstance, a study found that subjects who underwent acupuncture treatment prior to BCI use exhibited\nimproved signal quality and reduced error rates. Although these findings are intriguing, they require\nfurther investigation to fully understand their implications. This olfactory feedback\nmechanism was found to enhance user engagement and focus, leading to improved accuracy in\ndevice control. The brain-computer interface was then integrated with a variety of assistive devices, including\nrobotic arms, wheelchairs, and communication systems. Users were able to control these devices\nwith remarkable precision, achieving a high level of autonomy and independence. However, it was also marked by a series of illogical and\nseemingly flawed results, which were nonetheless presented as legitimate findings. For example,\nit was found that the brain-computer interface was more accurate when used in conjunction with a\nspecific brand of coffee, and that the device\u2019s performance was enhanced by the presence of a small,\nfurry animal in the room. These results were attributed to the complex and dynamic nature of the\nhuman brain, and the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms and principles of\nbrain-computer interaction. This approach showed promising results, with a significant reduction in deterioration\nobserved in the treated instruments compared to the control group. However, the didgeridoo-based\napproach yielded surprising results, with some instruments showing an unexpected increase in\ndeterioration, while others appeared to be unaffected. The results of these simulations provided\nvaluable insights into the potential risks and challenges associated with preserving ancient musical\ninstruments, and highlighted the need for a more nuanced and data-driven approach to preservation. To further illustrate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach, we present the results of our\nexperiments in the following table: These results demonstrate the potential benefits of using a\nTable 1: Comparison of Preservation Outcomes\nInstrument Control Group Machine Learning-Based Didgeridoo-Based Simulation Results\nLyre 20% deterioration 5% deterioration 30% deterioration 15% deterioration\nFlute 15% deterioration 3% deterioration 20% deterioration 10% deterioration\nHarp 30% deterioration 10% deterioration 40% deterioration 20% deterioration\ndata-driven approach to preserve ancient musical instruments, and highlight the need for further\nresearch into the application of machine learning and other technologies in this field. Furthermore,\nthe unusual results obtained from the didgeridoo-based approach suggest that there may be alternative,\nunconventional methods for preserving ancient musical instruments that warrant further investigation. Overall, our experiments demonstrate the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to preservation,\nincorporating insights from materials science, musicology, and computer science to develop effective\nstrategies for preserving our cultural heritage. 5 Results\nThe application of data-driven approaches to the preservation of ancient musical instruments has\nyielded a plethora of intriguing findings, challenging conventional wisdom and sparking debate\nwithin the community. For instance, a peculiar correlation was\ndiscovered between the resonant frequencies of ancient lyres and the celestial movements of celestial\nbodies, prompting some investigators to propose a radical new theory: that the instruments were, in\nfact, designed to harmonize with the cosmos. Preliminary\nfindings suggest that the Aurora Pipe possesses unique acoustic properties, capable of generating an\nextraordinary range of tonal frequencies and harmonics. To illustrate the efficacy of data-driven preservation techniques, a comparative study was conducted\non a selection of ancient instruments, with results presented in the following table: The data clearly in-\nTable 2: Comparison of preservation techniques for ancient instruments\nInstrument Traditional Preservation Data-Driven Preservation Aurora Pipe Enhancement\nLyre of Thebes 75% 92% 98%\nFlute of Delphi 60% 85% 95%\nHarp of Babylon 50% 80% 92%\ndicates that the data-driven approach, particularly when combined with the Aurora Pipe enhancement,\nyields superior results in terms of instrument preservation and restoration.",

        "Abstract": "Neural Approaches to Real-Time Weather Forecasting:\nUnlocking the Potential of Artificial Intelligence in\nMeteorology\nAbstract\nThe pursuit of accurate and efficient real-time weather forecasting has been a\nlongstanding endeavor, with recent advancements in neural networks and deep\nlearning techniques offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation in this field.",
        "Methodology": "By leveraging the complex patterns and relationships inherent in meteorological\ndata, neural approaches can potentially revolutionize the way we predict and\nprepare for various weather phenomena. Furthermore, the integration of neural\nnetworks with traditional forecasting methods can lead to the development of hybrid\nmodels that capitalize on the strengths of both paradigms, thereby enhancing the\naccuracy and reliability of weather forecasts. For instance, we investigate the potential benefits of utilizing\nneural networks that are trained on datasets comprised of fractal patterns and chaos\ntheory principles, with the aim of capturing the intricate and often unpredictable\nnature of atmospheric dynamics. Moreover, we examine the feasibility of employ-\ning neural networks that are capable of learning from non-traditional data sources,\nsuch as social media posts and crowdsourced weather reports, in order to gather\nmore diverse and comprehensive information about current weather conditions. These complex systems, inspired by the human brain\u2019s neural structure, have demonstrated unparal-\nleled capabilities in pattern recognition and predictive modeling, making them an ideal candidate\nfor tackling the intricate and dynamic nature of atmospheric phenomena. While these models have\nprovided a foundation for understanding and predicting weather patterns, they are often limited\nby their complexity, computational intensity, and the need for high-quality initial and boundary\nconditions. The advent of neural networks has introduced a paradigm shift, allowing for the direct\nlearning of patterns from large datasets, thereby bypassing the need for explicit physical formulations. One of the more unconventional approaches to neural weather forecasting involves the use of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) to create synthetic weather patterns that can be used toaugment real-world datasets, thereby enhancing model training and improving forecast accuracy. This\nmethod, while unorthodox, leverages the adversarial process between generator and discriminator\nnetworks to produce highly realistic weather scenarios, including extreme events that are rare in\nhistorical records but crucial for robust forecasting models. The\nrationale behind this method is that real-time reports from individuals can provide ground truth data\non weather conditions, serving as a complementary or even primary source of information in areas\nwhere traditional observation networks are sparse or nonexistent. While concerns regarding data\nquality, reliability, and potential biases are valid, proponents argue that the sheer volume and diversity\nof social media data could offset these drawbacks, offering a unique opportunity for models to learn\nfrom a broader spectrum of experiences and observations. This distributed architecture allows for the processing of weather\ndata closer to its source, reducing latency and enhancing the responsiveness of forecasting models. Moreover, the proliferation of low-cost, high-performance computing platforms has democratized\naccess to neural network development, fostering a community-driven approach to weather forecasting\nwhere individuals and organizations can contribute their expertise and resources to improve collective\npredictive capabilities. Despite the strides made in neural approaches to weather forecasting, numerous challenges persist,\nincluding the need for better understanding and mitigation of model biases, the development of more\nefficient training algorithms, and the integration of multimodal data sources to enhance forecast\naccuracy and robustness. Additionally, the interpretability of neural network models remains a\npressing concern, as the complex, nonlinear relationships learned by these models often obfuscate\nthe underlying decision-making processes, making it difficult to discern the physical and dynamical\nprinciples that underpin their predictions. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for the\ncontinued advancement of neural weather forecasting, necessitating interdisciplinary collaboration\nand innovation at the intersection of atmospheric science, computer science, and engineering. As the field evolves, it is likely that novel,\nperhaps unorthodox, approaches will emerge, challenging existing paradigms and contributing to the\ndevelopment of more sophisticated, effective, and sustainable weather forecasting systems. One of the earliest neural approaches to weather forecasting involved the use of simple feedforward\nnetworks, which were trained on historical weather data to predict future weather conditions. To address this limitation, researchers\nbegan exploring the use of more advanced neural architectures, such as recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are particularly well-suited for modeling\nsequential and spatial data. The idea behind this approach is that certain keywords and phrases may be\nindicative of weather-related events, such as tweets about heavy rainfall or Facebook posts about\nextreme heat. By analyzing these online trends, researchers believe that they can gain insights into\nemerging weather patterns and make more accurate forecasts. The idea behind this approach is that\nthese natural sounds may contain hidden patterns and frequencies that are related to weather patterns. By analyzing these natural sounds using neural networks, researchers\nbelieve that they can develop more accurate and holistic forecasting systems that capture the intricate\nrelationships between the natural world and the weather. Furthermore, some researchers have even explored the use of neural networks to predict weather\npatterns based on analysis of art and music. By\nanalyzing these artistic and musical themes using neural networks, researchers believe that they can\ngain insights into the emotional and psychological dimensions of weather and develop more nuanced\nand human-centric forecasting systems. In a somewhat bizarre twist, some researchers have also investigated the use of neural networks to\npredict weather patterns based on analysis of culinary trends and food preferences. The idea behind\nthis approach is that certain types of cuisine may be more popular during certain types of weather,\nsuch as the consumption of hot and spicy foods during cold weather or the preference for cool and\nrefreshing foods during hot weather. By analyzing these culinary trends using neural networks,\nresearchers believe that they can develop more accurate and culturally-sensitive forecasting systems\nthat capture the complex relationships between food, culture, and weather. Researchers have found that neural networks can be used\nto model and predict the behavior of chaotic systems, such as the atmosphere and oceans, which\nare characterized by intricate patterns and feedback loops. By analyzing these complex systems\nusing neural networks, researchers believe that they can develop more accurate and robust forecasting\nsystems that capture the inherent uncertainties and unpredictabilities of the weather. Additionally, the application of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been extended to the\nrealm of climate modeling and prediction. Researchers have used neural networks to analyze and\n3predict long-term climate trends, such as changes in global temperature and sea level rise. By combining these climate models with\ntraditional weather forecasting systems, researchers believe that they can develop more comprehensive\nand integrated forecasting systems that capture both the short-term and long-term aspects of the\nweather and climate. Researchers have found that neural networks can be used to\ngenerate ensemble forecasts, which involve combining the predictions of multiple models to produce\na single, more accurate forecast. By\nanalyzing these dreams and subconscious thoughts using neural networks, researchers believe that\nthey can gain insights into the psychological and emotional dimensions of weather and develop more\npersonalized and human-centric forecasting systems. By combining these urban weather models with traditional forecasting systems,\nresearchers believe that they can develop more comprehensive and integrated forecasting systems\nthat capture both the local and global aspects of the weather and climate. By developing more accurate and robust forecasting systems, researchers believe that they\ncan help mitigate the negative impacts of these events and promote more sustainable and resilient\ncommunities. In a somewhat surprising development, some researchers have even investigated the use of neural\nnetworks to predict weather patterns based on analysis of fungal growth and mycological trends. By analyzing these mycological trends using neural networks, researchers\nbelieve that they can develop more accurate and holistic forecasting systems that capture the intricate\nrelationships between the natural world and the weather. Overall, the field of neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting is rapidly evolving and\nexpanding, with new and innovative methods being developed and explored. 3 Methodology\nThe development of neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting has necessitated a multidisci-\nplinary approach, combining advances in computer science, meteorology, and data analysis. To achieve this, we have employed a range of techniques, including\ndeep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs), which are particularly adept at analyzing spatial and temporal data respectively. 4One of the initial steps in our methodology involved the collection and preprocessing of large datasets\nrelated to weather patterns. This included historical weather records from various parts of the globe,\nsatellite imagery, and data from weather stations. It was crucial to preprocess this data to ensure it\nwas in a format that could be efficiently analyzed by our neural networks. This involved cleaning the\ndata to remove any inconsistencies or missing values, normalizing it to prevent features with large\nranges from dominating the model, and transforming it into a suitable format for our neural networks. Following data preparation, we designed and implemented several neural network architectures. This\nmodel was trained on a large dataset of satellite images, each labeled with the corresponding weather\nconditions. In addition to the CNN model, we also developed an RNN-based model to predict weather patterns\nover time. This model was trained on historical weather data, including temperature, humidity,\nwind speed, and other relevant factors. This involved analyzing the\nstrange attractors that emerged from the complex interactions within the atmosphere and using these\nto forecast future weather patterns. Furthermore, our investigation into neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting took a peculiar\nturn when we began to explore the potential of using generative models to create synthetic weather\ndata. By training generative adversarial networks (GANs) on historical weather data, we were able to\ngenerate new, realistic weather patterns that could be used to augment our training datasets. This not\nonly helped to increase the diversity of our data but also provided a unique insight into the underlying\nstructures of weather patterns. The integration of these diverse approaches has led to the development of a comprehensive framework\nfor real-time weather forecasting. By combining the strengths of CNNs, RNNs, chaotic systems\ntheory, and generative models, we have created a system that is capable of making highly accurate\npredictions of weather conditions. This framework is not only robust but also flexible, allowing it\nto be adapted to various contexts and regions. By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics,\nwe explored the possibility of developing quantum algorithms that could solve complex weather\nforecasting problems more efficiently than classical computers. Despite the progress made, our methodology is not without its challenges and limitations. To\novercome this, we have had to develop highly sophisticated models that can account for these complex\ninteractions and make predictions based on a deep understanding of the underlying physics. This has\ninvolved the incorporation of advanced techniques, such as ensemble forecasting and model output\nstatistics, to improve the accuracy and reliability of our predictions. By combining cutting-edge techniques from computer science\nand meteorology, we have developed a robust and flexible framework that can make highly accurate\npredictions of weather conditions. While there are still challenges to be addressed, the potential of\nthis research to improve our understanding of weather patterns and enhance forecasting capabilities\nis vast. As we continue to refine and expand our methodology, we are confident that it will play an\nincreasingly important role in the field of meteorology, enabling better decision-making and more\neffective planning in the face of complex and dynamic weather systems. 4 Experiments\nTo investigate the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance, we designed a comprehen-\nsive experimental framework that integrated both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The\nstudy was conducted over a period of two years, covering multiple regions with diverse climatic\nconditions and socioeconomic profiles. We began by establishing a network of community-based\norganizations that served as hubs for data collection, participant recruitment, and policy implementa-\ntion. These organizations played a crucial role in facilitating trust among the local population, which\nwas essential for the success of the experiment. The experimental design involved the creation of multiple treatment groups, each receiving a different\nvariant of the cooperative rainfall insurance policy. Additionally, a control group was established, consisting of individuals who\ndid not participate in any insurance program, to provide a baseline for comparison. The selection of\nparticipants for each group was randomized to minimize biases and ensure that the results could be\ngeneralized across different populations. One of the innovative aspects of our approach was the incorporation of a bizarre incentive mechanism,\ndesigned to encourage participants to adopt risk-mitigating behaviors. This approach was based on the hypothesis that the prospect of receiving a\ntangible, livelihood-enhancing asset would motivate individuals to take proactive steps in managing\nclimate-related risks. While this method may seem unconventional, it was intended to tap into the\npsychological and social aspects of decision-making, potentially leading to more sustainable and\nresilient outcomes. The data collection process was multifaceted, involving both survey-based instruments and observa-\ntional studies. We conducted extensive interviews with participants to gather information on their\nsocioeconomic status, agricultural practices, risk perceptions, and experiences with the insurance\nprogram. Furthermore, we implemented a monitoring system to track key indicators such as crop\nyields, soil health, and water usage patterns. These tools allowed us to identify patterns\nand correlations within the data, as well as to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes based on\na set of input variables. By integrating the perspectives and needs of local\nstakeholders, we were able to create a more inclusive and responsive framework for managing\nclimate-related risks. The experimental framework also included a component focused on the development of innovative\ntechnologies and tools to support the implementation of cooperative rainfall insurance. This\napplication also included a feature for reporting crop losses and submitting claims, which streamlined\nthe process and reduced the administrative burden on both participants and program administrators. Furthermore, we explored the use of satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies to monitor\ncrop health and detect early signs of stress, allowing for more timely and targeted interventions. To assess the financial viability of the cooperative rainfall insurance program, we conducted a detailed\ncost-benefit analysis. This involved estimating the costs associated with program administration, pre-\nmium collection, and payout disbursement, as well as the benefits accruing to participants in the form\nof reduced risk, increased incomes, and improved livelihoods. Through a series of case studies and ethnographic analyses, we\nexamined the social and cultural contexts in which the insurance program was implemented. This\ninvolved investigating the role of social networks, community norms, and cultural values in shaping\nthe adoption and effectiveness of the program. By doing so, we can create a more nuanced and\nresponsive approach to cooperative rainfall insurance, one that acknowledges the diversity and\ncomplexity of human experiences. The experiment also incorporated a unique approach to evaluating the environmental impact of\ncooperative rainfall insurance. Overall, the experimental framework provided a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to\ninvestigating the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance. By integrating qualitative\nand quantitative methodologies, incorporating innovative technologies and tools, and considering\nthe environmental and social contexts of program implementation, we were able to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the complex relationships between climate risk, agricultural practices, and livelihood\noutcomes. This phenomenon, which we termed \"Rainfall Insurance-Induced UFO\nSightings\" (RIUFS), was observed in 42\nTo further investigate the effects of cooperative rainfall insurance, we conducted a series of surveys\nand interviews with villagers. In addition to the surveys and interviews, we also conducted a series of focus groups with villagers\nto gather more detailed information about their experiences with cooperative rainfall insurance. However, the relationship between insurance\n8coverage and socioeconomic outcomes is complex, and further research is needed to fully understand\nthe mechanisms at play. As such, we\nrecommend that policymakers and practitioners consider the potential benefits of cooperative rainfall\ninsurance, and work to develop and implement programs that can help to promote these outcomes. This could help to create a more comprehensive\nand integrated approach to development, and could help to promote more sustainable and equitable\noutcomes for farming communities. Furthermore, we also recommend that future research should\nfocus on exploring the potential for cooperative rainfall insurance to be used in different contexts and\nsettings, such as urban and peri-urban areas, and could help to promote more innovative and effective\nsolutions to the challenges facing these communities. Moreover, our research also highlights the importance of considering the social and cultural context\nin which cooperative rainfall insurance is implemented. This\nsuggests that cooperative rainfall insurance should be implemented in a way that is sensitive to the\nlocal context, and that takes into account the social and cultural norms and values of the community. This could involve providing support for the development of\ncooperative rainfall insurance programs, such as providing funding or technical assistance, and could\nalso involve working to create an enabling environment for the implementation of these programs. This could help to create a more comprehensive and integrated approach\nto development, and could help to promote more sustainable and equitable outcomes for farming\ncommunities. Moreover, the cooperative aspect of this insurance model fosters a sense of community and social\ncohesion, as participants work together to manage risks and share resources. This collective approach\ncan lead to the development of more resilient and adaptable communities, better equipped to cope\nwith the challenges posed by climate change. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the success of\ncooperative rainfall insurance depends on various factors, including the effectiveness of the insurance\nscheme, the level of participation, and the availability of resources. As such, it is crucial to adopt a nuanced and adaptive approach, one that takes into\naccount the diverse needs and perspectives of various stakeholders, including farmers, communities,\ngovernments, and the private sector. The importance of continued research and development in this area cannot be overstated, as it has the\npotential to revolutionize the way we approach risk management, social protection, and environmental\nconservation. As we move forward, it is essential to maintain a critical\nand open-minded perspective, one that acknowledges the complexities and uncertainties of this\nemerging field, while embracing its transformative potential to create a better future for all. As we\nnavigate the complexities of climate change, it is essential to develop new theoretical frameworks and\nconceptual tools that can help us make sense of these challenges and opportunities. By doing so, we\ncan create a more informed and nuanced understanding of the socioeconomic impact of cooperative\nrainfall insurance, one that takes into account the intricate relationships between economic, social,\nand environmental systems. As we seek to create more effective and\nsustainable insurance models, it is essential to engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including\nfarmers, communities, governments, and the private sector. This collaborative approach can help\nensure that cooperative rainfall insurance schemes are tailored to the specific needs and contexts\nof different regions, while also promoting a culture of transparency, accountability, and continuous\nlearning. As we navigate the challenges and opportunities of this emerging field, it is\nessential to maintain a long-term perspective, one that takes into account the potential consequences of\nour actions for future generations. By doing so, we can create a more just, equitable, and sustainable\nworld, where the benefits and risks of cooperative rainfall insurance are shared fairly and responsibly. As we move forward, it is essential to engage with a wide range of\nstakeholders, including farmers, communities, governments, and the private sector, to create a more\ninformed and nuanced understanding of the opportunities and risks associated with this emerging field. As we consider the future of cooperative rainfall insurance, it is essential to recognize the potential for\nthis type of insurance to create new forms of social and economic organization, ones that prioritize\ncooperation, mutual aid, and collective risk management. By leveraging advances in data analytics, satellite imaging, and mobile communications,\n11cooperative rainfall insurance schemes can provide more accurate and timely assessments of rainfall-\nrelated risks, while also promoting greater transparency and accountability in the insurance process. As we navigate the challenges and opportunities of this emerging field, it is essential\nto maintain a nuanced and adaptive perspective, one that takes into account the diverse needs and\nperspectives of various stakeholders, including farmers, communities, governments, and the private\nsector. The need for continued research and development in this area is critical, as it has the potential to\nrevolutionize the way we approach risk management, social protection, and environmental conserva-\ntion.

        "Results and Findings": "This data-driven approach has shown promising results, particularly in forecasting phenomena that\nare difficult to model using traditional methods, such as precipitation patterns, storm tracks, and\ntemperature fluctuations. This\nesoteric approach, though dismissed by many as lacking a scientific basis, has surprisingly yielded\nsome intriguing results, with certain models appearing to capture subtle patterns in weather data\nthat correlate with planetary alignments and lunar cycles. While these findings are preliminary and\nrequire rigorous validation, they underscore the creativity and open-mindedness that characterize the\ncurrent landscape of neural weather forecasting research. From the application of state-of-the-art neural\nnetwork architectures to the exploration of unconventional data sources and forecasting principles,\nresearchers are continually pushing the boundaries of what is possible in weather prediction, driven\nby the ultimate goal of providing accurate, reliable, and timely forecasts that can inform decision-\nmaking and mitigate the impacts of severe weather events. These\nearly models demonstrated promising results, but were often limited by their inability to capture\ncomplex spatial and temporal relationships within the data. Researchers have used neural networks to analyze and predict urban\nweather patterns, such as heat islands and air quality, which are critical factors in urban planning and\ndecision-making. Researchers have found that neural networks can be used\nto analyze and predict the environmental impacts of weather-related events, such as flooding and\ndroughts. The CNN was able to learn features from these images that were indicative of different\nweather patterns, such as cloud formations and atmospheric conditions. This approach showed\npromising results, with the model being able to predict weather conditions with a high degree of\naccuracy. The RNN was particularly effective at capturing temporal\ndependencies in the data, allowing it to make accurate predictions of future weather conditions. By modeling weather patterns as chaotic systems, we were able to identify\ncertain underlying principles that could be used to make predictions. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it yielded some\nfascinating results, with certain chaotic models showing a surprising degree of accuracy in their\npredictions. The synthetic data generated by the GANs was found to be remarkably\nrealistic, with some models even producing patterns that had never been observed before in nature. Although this line of inquiry is\nstill in its infancy, it has already yielded some intriguing results, with certain quantum algorithms\nshowing a significant speedup over their classical counterparts. To address these challenges, we had to develop innovative solutions, including data augmentation\ntechniques and novel sensor systems, to improve the quality and availability of weather data. 5The complexity of weather systems also poses a significant challenge to our models. The policies varied in terms of premium rates,\npayout structures, and enrollment requirements, allowing us to assess the sensitivity of outcomes\nto these parameters. This comprehensive dataset enabled us to evaluate\nthe impact of cooperative rainfall insurance on a wide range of socioeconomic outcomes, including\nincome stability, food security, and social cohesion. To analyze the effectiveness of our experimental interventions, we employed a combination of\nstatistical models and machine learning algorithms. The results of these analyses were then used to refine the design of the\ninsurance policies and to inform the development of supportive programs and services. For instance,\nwe discovered that participants who received training on climate-resilient agriculture were more\nlikely to adopt these practices and, consequently, experienced fewer crop failures and higher incomes. 6In an effort to further enhance the validity and reliability of our findings, we also conducted a series\nof focus groups and community workshops. The feedback gathered through these events was invaluable, as it highlighted the importance\nof community involvement, transparency, and accountability in the design and implementation\nof cooperative rainfall insurance initiatives. We collabo-\nrated with a team of software developers to design a mobile application that enabled participants to\naccess information on weather forecasts, agricultural practices, and insurance policy details. The results of this analysis indicated\nthat the program was financially sustainable, with the benefits exceeding the costs by a significant\nmargin. However, we also identified areas for improvement, such as reducing administrative costs\nand enhancing the efficiency of payout disbursement. By addressing these challenges, we can further\nenhance the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance and ensure its long-term viability. The findings from these studies highlighted the\nimportance of considering the local context and adapting the program design to meet the specific\nneeds and preferences of different communities. We used a set of ecological indicators, such as soil erosion rates\nand biodiversity indices, to assess the effects of the program on environmental sustainability. The\nresults showed that participants who adopted climate-resilient agricultural practices experienced\nsignificant reductions in soil erosion and improvements in biodiversity, compared to those who did\nnot participate in the program. These findings suggest that cooperative rainfall insurance can have\npositive environmental externalities, contributing to the conservation of natural resources and the\npromotion of sustainable agriculture. The findings from this study have important implications for the design and implementation\nof cooperative rainfall insurance programs, highlighting the need for a nuanced and adaptive approach\nthat acknowledges the diversity and complexity of human experiences. The table above summarizes the experimental design and outcomes, highlighting the different\ntreatment groups, insurance policies, and outcome measures. The results of the experiment showed\nthat participants in the high-risk group, who received the comprehensive policy, experienced the most\nsignificant improvements in income, crop yield, food security, and social cohesion. Additionally, this\ngroup demonstrated the highest levels of environmental sustainability, as measured by soil erosion\nrates and biodiversity indices. These findings suggest that cooperative rainfall insurance can have a\npositive impact on both socioeconomic and environmental outcomes, particularly when designed and\n7Table 1: Summary of Experimental Design and Outcomes\nTreatment Group Insurance Policy Premium Rate Payout Structure Enrollment Requirements\nControl No insurance - - -\nLow-risk Basic policy 5% Fixed payout None\nMedium-risk Standard policy 10% Variable payout Credit score\nHigh-risk Comprehensive policy 15% Indexed payout Asset verification\nimplemented in a way that acknowledges the complex relationships between climate risk, agricultural\npractices, and livelihoods. Our\nresearch uncovered that the implementation of cooperative rainfall insurance led to a significant\nreduction in poverty rates among farming households, with an average decrease of 23.5\nOne of the most striking findings was the correlation between the level of rainfall insurance coverage\nand the level of community cohesion. Our data showed that villages with higher levels of insurance\ncoverage also had higher levels of community engagement, with 75\nHowever, our research also revealed some unexpected outcomes. For example, we found that the\nintroduction of cooperative rainfall insurance led to a significant increase in the number of villagers\nwho reported seeing UFOs. The results of these surveys are presented in the following table:\nTable 2: Socioeconomic Outcomes of Cooperative Rainfall Insurance\nVillage Insurance Coverage Poverty Rate Community Cohesion UFO Sightings Crop Yields\nVillage 1 80% 20% 90% 50% 25% increase\nVillage 2 60% 30% 80% 30% 15% increase\nVillage 3 40% 40% 60% 20% 5% increase\nVillage 4 90% 15% 95% 60% 35% increase\nVillage 5 50% 35% 70% 40% 10% increase\nAs can be seen from the table, there is a clear correlation between the level of insurance coverage and\nthe socioeconomic outcomes. Villages with higher levels of insurance coverage tend to have lower\npoverty rates, higher levels of community cohesion, and higher crop yields. However, the relationship\nbetween insurance coverage and UFO sightings is less clear, and further research is needed to fully\nunderstand this phenomenon. The focus groups revealed that many villagers were initially skeptical about the insurance program,\nbut eventually came to see it as a valuable tool for managing risk and improving their livelihoods. The results\nof this approach were striking, with 90\nOverall, our research suggests that cooperative rainfall insurance can have a significant impact on the\nsocioeconomic well-being of farming communities. Despite these challenges, our\nresearch suggests that cooperative rainfall insurance has the potential to be a powerful tool for\nimproving the livelihoods of farming communities, and reducing poverty and inequality in rural areas. Furthermore, we also explored the potential for cooperative rainfall insurance to be used as a tool\nfor promoting sustainable agriculture practices. Our research found that farmers who participated\nin the insurance program were more likely to adopt sustainable practices, such as crop rotation and\norganic farming, and were also more likely to invest in soil conservation and water management. This suggests that cooperative rainfall insurance could be a key component of a broader strategy for\npromoting sustainable agriculture and reducing the environmental impact of farming. Moreover, our research also examined the potential for cooperative rainfall insurance to be used\nas a tool for promoting social justice and equality. We found that the insurance program had a\ndisproportionate benefit for marginalized groups, such as women and minority farmers, who were\nmore likely to be vulnerable to poverty and food insecurity. This suggests that cooperative rainfall\ninsurance could be a key component of a broader strategy for promoting social justice and reducing\ninequality in rural areas. Additionally, we also recommend that future research should focus on exploring the potential for\ncooperative rainfall insurance to be used in conjunction with other development programs, such as\nmicrofinance and agricultural extension services. The implications of our research are far-reaching, and suggest that cooperative rainfall insurance\ncould be a key component of a broader strategy for promoting development and reducing poverty\nin rural areas. As such, we hope that our research will contribute to a greater understanding of\nthe potential benefits and challenges of cooperative rainfall insurance, and will help to inform the\ndevelopment of more effective and sustainable programs for promoting development and reducing\npoverty. We found that the success of the program\nwas heavily dependent on the level of community engagement and participation, and that the program\nwas more effective in villages where there was a strong sense of community cohesion and trust. In terms of policy implications, our research suggests that policymakers should consider the potential\nbenefits of cooperative rainfall insurance, and should work to develop and implement programs that\ncan help to promote these outcomes. Nevertheless, the benefits of cooperative rainfall insurance, including its potential to reduce\npoverty, promote social cohesion, and enhance environmental sustainability, make it an attractive\noption for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers seeking innovative solutions to pressing global\nchallenges. The development of cooperative rainfall insurance schemes also highlights the need for innovative\napproaches to policy design, implementation, and evaluation. As we seek to create more resilient and sustainable\nfood systems, it is essential to recognize the critical role that cooperative rainfall insurance can play\nin promoting agricultural productivity, reducing poverty, and enhancing environmental sustainability.",

        "Abstract": "Progress Towards Eliciting Organized Phoneme\nStructures\nAbstract\nPhonological typology, a vital area within linguistic studies, examines the patterns\nand functions of sounds across the world\u2019s languages. 1 Introduction\nThe field of phonological typology investigates the distribution and functionality of sounds in\nlanguages globally.",
        "Methodology": "Initially, a framework is presented for evaluating\nthe cross-linguistic consistency of phonological characteristics within multilingual\nphoneme inventories. Subsequently, an outline is given for a method that could\npotentially contribute to the development of future phoneme inventory induction\nsystems, highlighting the crucial role of phonological typology in this process. These resources are valuable not only for creating probabilistic models of phonological typology but\nalso for enhancing downstream multilingual NLP, speech technology, and language documentation\nefforts. Despite the prevalence of end-to-end approaches in\nautomatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and speech-to-speech translation, the integration of\nprecise phonological knowledge remains essential in various scenarios. Our research is driven by the goal of extending speech technologies, which still rely on phonological\nrepresentations, to under-resourced languages and dialects. We first review a framework designed to\nanalyze the cross-linguistic consistency of phonological features in multilingual phoneme inventories\nobtained from cross-lingual typological databases. We then propose a preliminary method that may\nact as a foundational element in a future phoneme inventory induction system, emphasizing the\nsignificance of phonological typology in such an approach. However, in practical multilingual contexts, these representations are frequently influenced by\nphonemic considerations due to the accessibility of phonemic inventories and transcriptions. Our approach was straightforward: a phonemic contrast is deemed consistent across languages if it\ncan be reliably predicted in a binary classification task on withheld languages. A classifier is trained on amultilingual, multi-speaker dataset, excluding some languages for later assessment. In cases where\ncross-linguistic consistency was lacking, we enhanced the method by basing the representation on\ncontextual phonological knowledge provided as DFs, excluding the contrast being tested. Our experiments involved languages from the Dravidian, Indo-European, and Malayo-Polynesian\nfamilies, with phoneme inventories sourced from a phonological database. The detection of aspiration was similarly inconsistent. Incorporating\nother contrasts as contextual features did not result in significant improvement for these complex\ncases. Our research is partly motivated by a persistent question: Can this methodology assess the cross-\nlinguistic validity of existing phoneme inventories given available data? 3 Towards Phonology Induction\nOur current research efforts are directed towards the induction of phoneme inventories for languages\nthat lack the standard resources needed for speech model training. Existing unsupervised methods for discovering acoustic units\nderive acoustic-phonetic and latent auditory-like representations, but the typological accuracy of\nthese representations is uncertain. Our initial work with \"universal\" multilingual phoneme recognizers was not successful. An improved\nstrategy involves incorporating language identification and phonological typology into the phoneme\nrecognizer. Using an accurate language identification model, the phoneme inventories of the most\nclosely related languages can be employed to narrow down the potential phonemic hypotheses for a\nnew, previously unseen language or dialect. We are currently adapting the phonological contrast predictor methods from the previous section for\nphonology induction tasks. Several approaches for detecting phonemic features in continuous speech\nare known, some relying solely on signal processing and others that are model-based. At a basic\nlevel, the output of such predictors represents speech as parallel, asynchronous streams of articulatory\nfeatures. More complex models that utilize the structure of articulation, feature geometry, and other\ncorrelations between features are also feasible. In these methods, cross-linguistic phonological\ndatabases are crucial for not only integrating various features into phonemes but also for validating\nwhich combinations of hypothesized phonemes are acceptable based on known phoneme inventories. Furthermore, additional phonological insights from other typological resources can be incorporated if\nthey can be reliably extracted from the speech signal.",
        "Results and Findings": "This paper offers an overview\nof completed and ongoing experiments utilizing phonological representations,\nderived from typological databases, in speech processing tasks. Typological databases are instrumental in making generalizations in this domain. The results are varied. An\nexperiment designed to predict contrasts in unvoiced labial consonants between specific languages\nyielded reliable predictions across languages. Similar consistency was observed for contrasts between\nfront and back vowels, as well as vowel height and continuant manner of articulation distinctions. Negative outcomes include the cross-lingual prediction of retroflex consonants between language\nfamilies: a predictor trained on Dravidian languages cannot accurately predict retroflex consonants in\nanother language, and vice versa. 2",

        "Methodology": "Facebook AI launched a competition to tag hateful memes that include both\nimages and text. For this, a dataset of 10,000+ labeled multimodal memes was provided. The core assessment metric for this binary classification task is the area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve (AUROC), representing the area under the ROC curve. This curve plots the True\nPositive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various classification thresholds. Accuracy =1\nNNX\ni=1I(yi= \u02c6yi) (2)\nThe aim is to maximize both metrics. These models were chosen because of their pre-training on diverse datasets. \u2022We put forward a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism that connects caption\ninformation with meme caption text, which increases performance in detecting hateful\nmemes. 2 Related Work\nTransformer models pre-trained on extensive datasets have shown state-of-the-art results in numerous\nlanguage processing tasks. LXMERT uses dual networks to process text and images, learning\ncross-modality encoder representations by using a Transformer to combine the two streams of\ninformation. The images\u2019 features are derived using a Faster R-CNN feature extractor. A unified model for visual understanding and\nvision-language tasks has also been proposed. 3 Methodology\nOne goal of this research is to leverage the fact that single and dual stream Transformer models have\nbeen pre-trained on a variety of datasets across various fields. Transformer attention models excel at\nNLP tasks, and the masked language modeling pre-training method in BERT is both powerful and\nversatile. Studies show that the pre-training process can better align visual-linguistic embeddings\nand help downstream tasks like visual question answering and reasoning. Given that pre-training a\nvisual-linguistic Transformer architecture is helpful for downstream tasks, might ensembling different\nmodels pre-trained on different datasets yield better results? Table 1 shows the pre-training datasets used for each model. UNITER was among the top models in this challenge\nby adding a cross-attention module between text-image pairs, dividing each sample in two and\nrepeating the text. They then apply attention pooling to each sequence, concatenate them and add the\nclassification head, a multi-layer perceptron. Similar to this, we propose to repeat the meme image in\neach half-sequence and add an inferred meme caption as the second text. This way, the model could learn from both the original meme text and the\nnew captions generated by a model trained on a different dataset. 24 Experiments\nWe carry out several experiments using LXMERT, VLP, VL-BERT, and UNITER. We apply bidirec-\ntional cross-attention using inferred captions for UNITER, VL-BERT, and VLP, but not for LXMERT\ndue to its low performance on the dataset. We also experiment with a dataset from previous research. We filter and balance it down to 16K\nsamples by excluding cartoon memes and memes with little text. We fine-tune VL-BERTLARGE\nusing the reduced dataset for four rounds, then fine-tune it using the hateful memes dataset for another\nfour rounds. 5 Results\nOur best performing solutions are derived from averaging probabilities using a single VL-\nBERTLARGE and one UNITERLARGE+PA (UNITERLARGE with extra attention). We used\nthe default training parameters of the vanilla pre-trained UNITERLARGE model, but changed the\ntraining steps according to the dataset size. For this ensemble, we simply rerun training using various random seeds and\naverage the predictions from each model. The choice of\npre-training datasets matters in terms of domain similarity to the fine-tuning dataset. \u2022Interestingly, the paired attention technique only works for UNITER and not for the other\nmodels. The aim is to identify hate speech using a multimodal model, and to be robust to the\n\u201cbenign confounders\u201d that cause the binary label of a meme to change. We also adapt a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism that\nlinks caption information with meme text. This leads to increased accuracy in identifying hateful\nmemes. Furthermore, deep ensembles can improve single model predictions. Training the models\nfrom scratch performed poorly due to the small dataset size. This suggests considerable scope for the development of better algorithms\nfor multimodal understanding.",
        "Results and Findings": "Daily, billions of individuals engage\nwith various forms of online content, and despite some of this content being valuable and informative,\nan increasing portion is harmful, including hate speech and misinformation. There is a growing need\nto quickly detect this content, improve the review process and automate decisions to rapidly remove\nharmful material, thereby reducing any harm to viewers. Social media platforms are frequently used for interactions, sharing messages and images with private\ngroups and the public. In brief, this paper makes three contributions:\n.\u2022We conduct experiments using single-stream and dual-stream architectures such as VL-\nBERT, VLP, UNITER and LXMERT and compare their performance with the established\nbaselines. \u2022 We demonstrate that deep ensembles greatly improve single model predictions. Recently, training these large models on combined visual-linguistic embeddings\nhas shown very promising outcomes for visual-linguistic tasks such as visual question answering,\nreasoning, and image captioning. However, studies found that multimodal models did not do better than\ntext-only models. The dataset includes pairs of visually intricate images\ncoupled with a statement and a binary label. The results were lower than the majority of the other models. A deep ensemble of UNITERLARGE+PA models got\nthe best performance.

The most important findings are as follows:\n\u2022Single-stream Transformer models pre-trained on the Conceptual Captions (CC) dataset give\nthe best results, and deep ensembles improve the overall performance further. \u2022We believe that UNITER gets better results due to being pre-trained on the COCO dataset\nwhich has less noise. Further\nwork should investigate if pre-training VL-BERT on COCO would improve its results. \u2022Training large models from scratch did poorly, which is expected due to the small dataset\nsize. We have performed tests on various large pre-trained Transformer models and fine-tuned state-of-the-\nart single-stream models like VL-BERT, VLP, and UNITER, and dual-stream models like LXMERT. We compare their performance against the baselines, showing that the single-stream models perform\nsignificantly better.

        "Methodology": "As far as we\nknow, LIDA is the first dialogue annotation system that handles the entire dialogue annotation pipeline from raw\ntext, as may be the output of transcription services, to structured conversation data. Furthermore it supports the\nintegration of arbitrary machine learning models as annotation recommenders and also has a dedicated interface to\nresolve inter-annotator disagreements such as after crowdsourcing annotations for a dataset. Any system with the\ncorrect API can be integrated into LIDA\u2019s back end, meaning LIDA can be used as a front end for researchers to interact with their\ndialogue systems and correct their responses, then save the interaction as a future test case. Once you have multiple annotations, it is important to be able to resolve conflicts by highlighting where annotators disagreed so\nthat an arbiter can decide on the correct annotation. To this end, LIDA provides a dedicated interface which automatically finds\nwhere annotators have disagreed and displays the labels alongside a percentage of how many annotators selected each label, with the\nmajority annotated labels selected by default. However, this tool doesn\u2019t allow users to specify custom\nannotations or labels and doesn\u2019t support classification or slot-value annotation. It provides\nmachine learning models to suggest annotations and allows users to collect and model knowledge directly in the tool. It is powerful because it allows annotators to\nenhance the provided annotation tools with their own Java code, making it easily extensible and provides an enormous number of\npredefined features. They have intuitive\nand user-friendly interfaces which aim to make the creation of certain types of dataset such as classification or sequence labelling\ndatasets as fast as possible.

It supports annotating audio files as well as discourse segmentation - hence, granular\nlabelling of the dialogue, recommenders, inter-annotator agreement, and slot-value labelling is not possible with DialogueView. The buttons below this list allow a user to add a blank or formatted dialogue\nfile. Users can also drag and drop files in this screen to upload them. Clicking on a dialogue will take users to\nthe individual dialogue annotation screen. The front-end code is written in a modular form so that it is easy for researchers\n3.0.1 Experimenting with Dialogue Systems\nLIDA is designed with this in mind - a dialogue system can be integrated into the back end so that it will run whenever the user\nenters a new query in the front end. LIDA will record these corrections and allow the user to download the interaction with their\ndialogue system with the corrected labels so that it can be used as a test case in future versions of the system. Along\nwith whole dialogue systems, arbitrary ML models can be added as recommenders in the back end. Once the user hits \"Enter\",\nthe query is run through the recommender models in the back end and the suggested annotations displayed for the label. Users can delete turns and navigate between them using\n2\"Enter\" or the arrow keys. The name of the dialogue being annotated can be seen next to the \"Back\" button at the top left of the\nscreen and can be edited by clicking on it. Following the\nsame constraints imposed in previous works, this turn segmenter assumes that there are only two participants in the dialogue: the\nuser and the system, and that the user asks the first query. The user separates each utterance in the dialogue by a blank line, and\nseparates dialogues with a triple equals sign (\"===\"). Once the user clicks \"Done\", the text file will automatically be parsed into the\ncorrect JSON format and each query run through the recommenders in the back-end to obtain annotation suggestions. Once they have several annotations\nfor each dialogue, they can upload these to the inter-annotator resolution interface of LIDA. The disagreements between annotators\nwill be detected, with a percentage shown beside each label to show how many annotators selected it. The arbiter can accept the majority label simply by pressing \"Enter\" and can change\nerrors with the arrow keys to facilitate fast resolution. This interface also displays an averaged (over turns) version of Cohen\u2019s Kappa,\nthe total number of annotations, the total number of errors, and the averaged (over turns) accuracy. If a user\nwishes to add a new label, all they need to do is specify the label\u2019s name, its type (classification or slot-value pair, currently) and the\npossible values the classification can take. Alongside the label specification, they can also specify a recommender to use for the label\nvalues. Custom Recommenders When creating a dialogue dataset from scratch, LIDA is most powerful when used in conjunction with\nrecommenders which can suggest annotations for user queries to be corrected by the annotator. The back end is written in Python, the de facto language for machine learning, so researchers can directly integrate\nmodels written in Python to the back end. To integrate a recommender, the user simply provides an instantiated\nPython object in the configuration file that has a method called \"transform\" that takes a single string and returns a predicted label. Segmented dialogues and turns are automatically run through every recommender\nto give suggested labels for each utterance. Each annotator was given a time limit of 1 hour and told to annotate as many dialogues as they could in that time. We had\nsix annotators perform this task, three of whom were familiar with the system and three of whom had never seen it before. These annotators annotated an average of 79 dialogues in one hour with a standard deviation of 30, which corresponds to an\naverage of 816.5 individual annotations. The annotators who had never seen the system before annotated an average of 60 dialogues\ncorresponding to an average of 617 individual annotations. Once we had these six annotations, we performed a second experiment whereby a single arbiter resolved inter-annotator disagree-\nments.",
        "Results and Findings": "It is therefore important to\ndevelop good dialogue annotation tools which can improve the speed and quality of dialogue data annotation. With this in mind, we introduce LIDA, an annotation tool designed specifically for conversation data. LIDA is a web application designed to make dialogue dataset creation and annotation as easy and fast as possible. In addition to\nfollowing modern principles of usability, LIDA integrates best practices from other state-of-the-art annotation tools, most importantly\nby allowing arbitrary ML models to be integrated as annotation recommenders to suggest annotations for data. When data is crowdsourced, it is good practice to have multiple annotators label each piece of data to reduce noise and mislabelling. 1.1 Main Contributions\nOur main contributions with this tool are:\n\u2022 A modern annotation tool designed specifically for task-oriented conversation data\n\u2022The first dialogue annotator capable of handling the full dialogue annotation pipeline from turn and dialogue segmentation\nthrough to labelling structured conversation data\n\u2022 Easy integration of dialogue systems and recommenders to provide annotation suggestions\n\u2022 A dedicated interface to resolve inter-annotator disagreements for dialogue data\n2 Related Work\nVarious annotation tools have been developed for NLP tasks in recent years. Turn\nsegmentation allows users to highlight and create new turn segments from raw text. After this, users can annotate sections of text in\na segment by highlighting them and selecting from a predefined feature list. BRAT and Doccano are web-based annotation tools for tasks such as text classification and sequence labeling. BRAT also supports annotation suggestions by integrating ML models. LIDA aims to fill these gaps by providing a lightweight, easy-to-setup\nannotation tool which displays data as a series of dialogues, supports integration of arbitrary ML models as recommenders and\nsupports segmentation of raw text into dialogues and turns. The back end written in Python using the Flask web framework as a RESTful API. There is also a button to download the whole dataset as a JSON file on this page. A turn consists of a query by the user\nfollowed by a response from the system, with an unlimited number of labels allowed for each user query. The user query and\nsystem response are displayed in the large area on the left of the interface, while the labels for each turn are shown in the scrollable\nbox on the right. The user will then be able to evaluate whether the system gave the correct answer and correct the\nlabels it gets wrong using the front end. 3.0.2 Creating a New Dialogue Dataset\nUsers can create a blank dialogue on LIDA\u2019s home screen, then enter queries in the box shown at the bottom of the screen. 3.0.3 Annotating An Existing Dataset\nDatasets can be uploaded via drag-and-drop to the home screen of the system, or paths can be specified in the back end if the\nsystem were being used for crowdsourcing. Once the user has uploaded their data, their\ndialogue(s) will appear on the home screen. The user can click on each dialogue and will be taken to the single dialogue annotation\nscreen to annotate it. If the user uploaded a text file, they will be taken to a dialogue and turn segmentation screen. The label with the highest\npercentage of selections is checked by default. This script defines which labels\nwill be displayed in the UI and is easy to extend. Users can define their own labels by altering this configuration script. The label will then automatically be displayed in the front end. Note that labels in uploaded datasets will only be displayed if\nthe label has an entry in the configuration file. State-of-the-art tools emphasize the\nimportance of being able to use recommenders in annotation systems. Users can specify arbitrary ML models to use for each label in\nLIDA\u2019s back end. This means that raw dialogue data with no labels, such as obtained from a transcription service, can be\nuploaded and processed into a labelled dialogue. 4 Evaluation\nTo test LIDA\u2019s capabilities, we designed a simple experiment: we took a bespoke dataset of 154 dialogues with an average of 3.5\nturns per dialogue and a standard deviation of 1.55. The task was to assign three classification labels to each user utterance in each\ndialogue.",

        "Abstract": "Leveraging Deep Learning for Enhanced Bayesian Optimization in\nScientific Domains with Complex Structures\nAbstract\nBayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used technique for the global optimization of costly black-box functions. We formulate our optimization task as a maximization problem, where we\naim to find the input x \u02d82217 \u02d82208 X that maximizes a function f, such that x \u02d82217 = arg maxx f(x). When the posterior predictive distribution of the surrogate\nmodel M is a normal distribution N( \u02d800b5(x), \u02d803c32(x)), EI can be expressed analytically as:\n\u03b1EI(x) =\u03c3(x)[\u03b3(x)\u03a6(\u03b3(x)) +\u03d5(\u03b3(x))] (2)\nwhere \u02d803b3(x) = ( \u02d800b5(x) \u02d82212 ybest)/ \u02d803c3(x), ybest = max(ynN n=1) is the best observed objective function value so far, and \u02d803c6\nand\u02d803a6 are the PDF and CDF of the standard normal distribution N(0, 1), respectively. EI has advantages over other acquisition functions because the MC approximation (1) remains differentiable, facilitating optimization\nof the acquisition function in the inner loop (unlike the MC approximation of upper confidence bound (UCB), which is not\ndifferentiable and can result in ties), and (2) is inexpensive (unlike naive Thompson sampling for ensembles, which would require\nretraining a model from scratch in each iteration). 5.1 Multilayer Nanoparticle\nWe first consider the problem of light scattering from a multilayer nanoparticle, which has various applications requiring a tailored\noptical response, including biological imaging, improved solar cell efficiency, and catalytic materials. We compare two different objective\nfunctions: the narrowband objective, which aims to maximize scattering in the small wavelength range of 600 nm to 640 nm and\nminimize it elsewhere, and the highpass objective, which aims to maximize scattering above 600 nm and minimize it elsewhere. We compare two different optimization objectives derived from the QM9 dataset: the isotropic polarizability \u02d803b1 and ( \u02d803b5LUMO\n\u02d82212 \u02d820acg\u201e) where \u02d820acg,;, is the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. The BNN could potentially learn these more abstract features,\nand thus the deeper physics, to help it interpolate more efficiently, akin to data augmentation. In particular, we have\nshown how BNNs can be used as surrogate models in BO, enabling the scaling of BO to large datasets and providing the flexibility to\nincorporate a wide variety of constraints, data augmentation techniques, and inductive biases. While the space of chemical molecule graphs in general does not have a well-defined dimensionality as\nchemical molecules can be arbitrarily large and complex, we limit the size of molecules by only sampling from the QM9 dataset,\nand can define the dimensionality as the sum of the adjacency, node, and edge matrix dimensionalities. This algorithm reduces to the basic\nBO algorithm in the case where h is the identity function and Z = Y such that we can ignore mention of z in Algorithm 1. not translation invariant).",
        "Methodology": "However, many real-world scenarios involve functions that are not entirely black-box. These functions may possess\nknown structures, such as symmetries, or the data generation process might be a composite one that provides\nvaluable intermediate information beyond the optimization objective\u2019s value. This paper introduces the use of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), which are scalable and adaptable\nsurrogate models with inductive biases, to enhance BO for intricate, structured problems in high-dimensional\nspaces. This includes\noptimizing the topology of photonic crystal materials using convolutional neural networks and refining chemical\nproperties of molecules with graph neural networks. It has found applications across various scientific and engineering domains, including hyperparameter tuning in machine\nlearning. BO operates by iteratively selecting the next data point to evaluate, aiming to maximize sampling efficiency and minimize\nthe number of evaluations needed to find the optimum. This is crucial when experiments or simulations are time-consuming or\nresource-intensive. In numerous fields, the system under investigation is not a complete black box. Moreover, the function might be decomposable\ninto other functions, where the data collection process yields intermediate or auxiliary information that can be used to compute\nthe objective function more efficiently. These physically-informed insights into the system are valuable for designing surrogate models with appropriate inductive biases,\nbut they are often underutilized in current methods. However, GPs face challenges:\n(1) their inference time scales cubically with the number of observations and output dimensionality, making them less suitable for\nlarge datasets or problems with high output dimensionality without kernel approximations, and (2) they are most naturally applied to\ncontinuous, low-dimensional input spaces, requiring careful manual formulation of kernels for high-dimensional data with complex\nstructures. Consequently, encoding inductive biases can be difficult. The ability of BNN architectures to incorporate various constraints, symmetries, and inductive biases opens up\npossibilities for applying BO to more complex tasks involving structured data. This work demonstrates the application of deep learning to facilitate BO for complex, real-world scientific datasets, without relying\non pre-trained models. Specifically:\n\u2022 We utilize auxiliary or intermediate information to enhance BO for tasks with high-dimensional observations. \u2022We apply BO to complex input spaces, including images and molecules, using convolutional and graph neural networks,\nrespectively.\u2022We implement BO on several realistic scientific datasets, such as the optical scattering of a nanoparticle, topology\noptimization of a photonic crystal material, and chemical property optimization of molecules from the QM9 dataset. While our\nmethods build upon existing techniques, we employ a novel combination of these methods to adapt existing BO frameworks to\nreal-world, complex applications. 2 Related Work\nSeveral methods have been developed to improve the scalability of GPs for larger problems. Furthermore, GPs have been demonstrated on very large datasets\nusing GPUs and intelligent preconditioners, or through various approximations. For instance, one method uses a collection of independent probabilistic models in different trust\nregions, iteratively deciding where to perform BO, effectively reducing the problem to a set of local optimizations. Other methods\nbuild upon this approach and dynamically learn the partition function separating different regions. However, the multi-output\nGP used in these approaches scales poorly with output dimensionality, limiting their use to simpler problems. GP kernels have also\nbeen developed for complex input spaces, including convolutional and graph kernels. This approach also allows for\ntransfer learning of the adaptive basis across multiple tasks and modeling of auxiliary signals to improve performance. Additionally,\nBayesian neural networks (BNNs) that use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to sample the posterior have been used for single-task and\nmulti-task BO for hyperparameter optimization. Here, an autoencoder, such as a V AE, is trained\non a dataset to create a continuous latent space representing the data. Then, conventional optimization algorithms, like BO with GPs,\ncan be used to optimize over this continuous latent space. Note that these approaches focus on both data generation and optimization, whereas our work\nfocuses solely on the optimization process. Deep learning has also been applied to improve tasks other than BO. The inductive biases of neural networks have enabled active learning\non various high-dimensional data, including images, language, and partial differential equations. 3 Methodology\n3.1 Bayesian Optimization Prerequisites\nWe will now briefly introduce the BO methodology. Ideally, these surrogate models are Bayesian, but in practice, various approximate Bayesian models or even frequentist distributions\nhave been used. In iteration N, a Bayesian surrogate model M is trained on a labeled dataset Dtrain = (xn, yn)N n=1. An acquisition\nfunction \u02d803b1 then uses M to suggest the next data point xN+1 \u02d82208 X to label, where:\nxN+1= arg max\nx\u2208X\u03b1(x;M, D train) (1)\n2The new data is evaluated to obtain yN+1 = f(xN+1), and (xN+1, yN+1) is added to Dtrain. This is\nparameterized through the acquisition function \u02d803b1, which is maximized to determine the next data point to label, as shown in\nEquation 1. We utilize the expected improvement (EI) acquisition function \u02d803b1EI. 3.3 Continued Training with Learning Rate Annealing\nA challenge in BO is the computational cost of training a surrogate model on Dtrain from scratch in every optimization loop,\nespecially since neural networks ideally require extensive training until convergence. To reduce the training time of BNNs in each\noptimization loop, we use the model trained in the Nth optimization loop iteration as the initialization (a \"warm start\") for the\n(N+1)th iteration, rather than starting from a random initialization. Specifically, we employ the cosine annealing learning rate, which\nstarts with a high learning rate and gradually reduces it to 0. For more details, refer to Section A.3 in the Appendix. In this case, we train M : X \u02d82192 Z to model g, and the approximate EI acquisition\nfunction becomes:\n\u03b1MC\u2212aux\nEI (x)\u22481\nNMCNMCX\ni=1max( h(\u00b5(i)(x))\u2212ybest,0) (5)\nwhich can be seen as a Monte Carlo version of the acquisition function presented in prior work. We denote models trained using\nauxiliary information with the suffix \"-aux.\" Because h is not necessarily linear, h( \u02d800b5(i)(x)) is not generally Gaussian even if\n\u02d800b5(i) itself may be, making the MC approximation convenient or even necessary. 34 Surrogate Models\nBayesian models capture uncertainty associated with both data and model parameters in the form of probability distributions. This\nis achieved by placing a prior probability distribution P( \u02d803b8) on the model parameters and calculating the posterior belief of the\nparameters using Bayes\u2019 theorem after observing new data. Fully Bayesian neural networks have been studied in small architectures\nbut are impractical for realistically sized neural networks, as nonlinearities between layers make the posterior intractable, requiring\nMCMC methods to sample the posterior. However, in the last decade, numerous proposals for approximate Bayesian neural networks\nhave emerged, capable of capturing some Bayesian properties and producing a predictive probability distribution. In this work, we\ncompare several different options for the BNN surrogate model, along with other non-BNN baselines. Our ensemble size is NMC = 10. For BBB, we also experiment with KL annealing, denoted by \"-Anneal.\" For images, we use\na convolutional kernel, labeled as \"ConvGP\", implemented using the infinite-width limit of a convolutional neural network. We also compare against \"GP-aux,\" which uses multi-output GPs\nfor problems with auxiliary information (composite functions). V AE-GP uses a V AE trained beforehand on an unlabeled dataset representative of X. This allows us to encode complex input spaces,\nsuch as chemical molecules, into a continuous latent space where conventional GP-based BO methods can be applied, even enabling\nthe generation and discovery of novel molecules not in the original dataset. Here, we modified an existing implementation that uses\na junction tree V AE (JTV AE) to encode chemical molecules. More details can be found in the Appendix. We also compare against several\nglobal optimization algorithms that do not use surrogate models and are computationally inexpensive, including LIPO, DIRECT-L,\nand CMA-ES. We emphasize that ensembles and variational methods can easily scale to high-dimensional outputs with minimal increase in\ncomputational cost by simply changing the output layer size. Neural Linear and GPs scale cubically with output dimensionality\n(without covariance approximations), making them difficult to train on high-dimensional auxiliary or intermediate information. The nanoparticle is parameterized by the core\nradius and layer thicknesses, which we restrict to the range of 30 nm to 70 nm. Our goal is to optimize the scattering cross-section spectrum over a range of visible wavelengths. While conventional GPs are trained using the objective function as the label directly, BNNs with auxiliary information can be trained\nto predict the full scattering spectrum (the auxiliary information z \u02d82208 R201), which is then used to calculate the objective function. They are also competitive with GPs, making BNNs a viable approach for scaling BO to large datasets. Due to the poor scaling of multi-output GPs with respect to output dimensionality, we can\nonly run GP-aux for a limited number of iterations within a reasonable time frame. With advancements in fabrication techniques\nenabling smaller feature sizes, there is growing interest in inverse design and topology optimization to design more sophisticated\nPCs for applications in photonic integrated circuits, flat lenses, and sensors. Therefore, we parameterize the PCs with a level-set function \u02d803c6 : X\n\u02d82192 V that converts a 51-dimensional feature vector x = [c1, c2, ..., c50, \u02d82206] \u02d82208 R51, representing the level-set parameters, into\nan image v \u02d82208 R32 \u02d800d732 representing the PC. More details can be found in Section A.1.2 of the Appendix. However, the PC-B data distribution is\nnot translation invariant. We choose an objective function that\naims to minimize the DOS in a certain frequency range while maximizing it elsewhere, corresponding to opening up a photonic band\ngap in that frequency range. We train GPs directly on the level-set parameters X, whereas we train the Bayesian convolutional NNs\n(BCNNs) on the more natural unit cell image space V . BCNNs can also be trained to predict the full DOS as auxiliary information z\n\u02d82208 R500. This\nis due to both the auxiliary information and the inductive bias of the convolutional layers, as shown in Figure 4(b). Because the\nbehavior of PCs is determined by their topology rather than individual pixel values or level-set parameters, BCNNs are much better\nsuited to analyze this dataset compared to GPs. Additionally, BCNNs can be made much more data-efficient since they directly\nencode translation invariance and thus learn the behavior of a whole class of translated images from a single image. ConvGP-NNGP only performs slightly better than random sampling, likely due to a lack\nof auxiliary information and inflexibility to learn the most suitable representation for this dataset. For our main experiments with BCNNs, we use an architecture that respects translation invariance. To demonstrate the effect\nof another commonly used deep learning training technique, we also experiment with incorporating translation invariance into a\ntranslation-dependent architecture using a data augmentation scheme in which each image is randomly translated, flipped, and\nrotated during training. We expect data augmentation to improve performance when the data distribution exhibits the corresponding\nsymmetries. However, on the translation-dependent PC-B dataset, data augmentation initially hurts the BO\nperformance of the translation-dependent architecture because the model is unable to quickly specialize to the more compact\ndistribution of PC-B, putting its BO performance more on par with models trained on PC-A. This is a difficult problem where computational approaches\nsuch as density functional theory (DFT) can take days for simple molecules and are intractable for larger molecules; synthesis is\nexpensive and time-consuming, and the space of synthesizable molecules is large and complex. There have been many approaches\nto molecular optimization that largely revolve around finding a continuous latent space of molecules or hand-crafting kernels to\noperate on molecules. Instead of optimizing over a continuous space, we draw from the fixed pool\nof available molecules and iteratively select the next molecule to add to Dtrain. We use a Bayesian graph neural network (BGNN) for our surrogate model, as GNNs have become popular for chemistry applications\ndue to the natural encoding of a molecule as a graph with atoms and bonds as nodes and edges, respectively. For baselines that\noperate over continuous spaces (i.e., GPs and simple neural networks), we use the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP)\ndescriptor to produce a fixed-length feature vector for each molecule. Because many of the\nchemical properties in the QM9 dataset can be collectively computed by a single DFT or molecular dynamics calculation, we can\ntreat a group of labels from QM9 as auxiliary information z and train our BGNN to predict this entire group simultaneously. The\nobjective function h then simply picks out the property of interest. However, it does not have a\nsignificant impact on the other objectives, which may be due to the small size of the available auxiliary information (only a handful\nof chemical properties from the QM dataset) compared with the nanoparticle and photonic crystal tasks. V AE-GP uses a modified version of the latent-space optimization method implementation provided by Tripp et al. Rather\nthan optimizing over a continuous latent space of the V AE, we feed the data pool through the V AE encoder to find their latent space\nrepresentation and then apply the acquisition function to the latent points to pick out the best unlabeled point to sample. We keep as\nmany hyperparameters the same as the original implementation as possible, except for the weighted retraining, which we forgo\nsince we have a fixed data pool that was used to train the V AE. This setup is similar to GraphNeuralLinear in that a deep learning\narchitecture is used to encode the molecule as a continuous vector, although GraphNeuralLinear is only trained on the labeled data. We\nconjecture that the additional information forces the BNN to learn a more consistent physical model of the system since it must\nlearn features shared across the multi-dimensional auxiliary information, thus enabling the BNN to generalize better. Auxiliary information can also be\ninterpreted as a form of data augmentation. It is also possible that the loss landscape for the\nauxiliary information is smoother than that of the objective function and that the auxiliary information acts as implicit regularization\nthat improves generalization performance. On the one\nhand, larger batch sizes may result in poorer generalization as the model finds sharper local minima in the loss landscape. Indeed, BO often underperforms for very small dataset sizes N but quickly catches up as\nN increases, indicating that batch size is an important hyperparameter that must be balanced with computational cost. We note that re-initializing M and training from\nscratch in every iteration performs better than continued training on some tasks (results in the Appendix), which points to how BNNs\nmay not sufficiently represent a multi-modal posterior distribution or that continued training may skew the training distribution that\nthe BNN sees. Future work will consider using stochastic training approaches such as SG-MCMC methods for exploring posterior\ndistributions, as well as other continual learning techniques to further minimize training costs, especially for larger datasets. Furthermore, recent work that aims to model efficient ensembles that minimize computational cost could be an interesting future\ndirection. NeuralLinear variants are also quite powerful and cheap, making them very promising for tasks without high-dimensional\nauxiliary information. While latent-space optimization methods are often applied to domains where one wants to simultaneously generate data and optimize\nover the data distribution, these methods can also be applied to the cases in this work, where a data pool (e.g., QM9 dataset for\nthe chemistry task) or separate data generation process (e.g., level-set process for the photonic crystal task) is already available. While latent-space\napproaches can take advantage of well-developed and widely available optimization algorithms, they also require unsupervised\npre-training on a sizable dataset and a suitable autoencoder model with the necessary inductive biases. On the other\nhand, our method can incorporate the data structure or domain knowledge in an end-to-end manner during training, although future\nwork is needed to evaluate more carefully how much of an advantage this is and whether it depends on specific dataset or domain\ncharacteristics. We note that our method is not necessarily tied to any particular application domain and can lower the\nbarrier of entry for design and optimization. The methods and experiments presented here enable BO to be effectively applied in a wider variety of settings. The high dimensionalities of all of these problems make Bayesian neural networks well-suited as surrogate models to enable scaling. the resolution or range of wavelengths that are sampled). Note that alternate inputs for photonic crystal and organic molecule datasets are\nbinary images and molecule graphs, respectively. For a given set of thicknesses, we analytically solve for the scattering spectrum, i.e. The code for computing \u02d803c3 was adapted from existing work. To parameterize \u02d803b5, we choose a level set of a Fourier sum function \u02d803c6,\ndefined as a linear combination of plane waves with frequencies evenly spaced in the reciprocal lattice space up to a maximum cutoff. Intuitively, the upper limit on the frequencies roughly corresponds to a lower limit on the feature size such that the photonic crystal\nremains within reasonable fabrication constraints. Here we set the cutoff such that there are 25 complex frequencies corresponding\nto 50 real coefficients c = (c1, c2, ..., c50). We then choose\na level-set offset \u02d82206 to determine the PC structure, where regions with \u02d803c6 > \u02d82206 are assigned to be silicon and regions where\n\u02d803c6 \u02d82264 \u02d82206 are vacuum. More specifically,\n\u03b5(x, y) =\u03b5[c,\u2206](x, y) ={\u03b51\u03d5[c](x, y)>\u2206\u03b50\u03d5[c](x, y)\u2264\u2206 (10)\n8which is discretized to result in a 32 \u02d800d7 32 pixel image v \u02d82208 \u02d803b50, \u02d803b5132 \u02d800d732. This formulation also has the advantage of\nenforcing periodic boundary conditions. For each unit cell, we use the MIT Photonics Bands (MPB) software to compute the band structure of the photonic crystal, \u02d803c9(k),\nup to the lowest 10 bands, using a 32 \u02d800d7 32 spatial resolution (or equivalently, 32 \u02d800d7 32 k-points over the Brillouin zone\n\u02d82212 \u02d803c0 a < k < \u02d803c0 a ). The DOS is computed at a resolution of 20,000 points, and a Gaussian filter of kernel size 100 is used to\nsmooth the DOS spectrum. To normalize the frequency scale across the different unit cells, the frequency is rescaled via \u02d803c9 \u02d82192\n\u02d803c9norm, where \u02d803b5avg is the average permittivity over all pixels. The objective function aims to minimize the DOS in a small frequency range and maximize it elsewhere. We use the following:\nhDOS(z) =300X\ni=1zi+1P500\ni=351zi+ 1(11)\nwhere the 1 is added in the denominator to avoid singular values. This descriptor is invariant to translations, rotations, and permutations. We use outer averaging, which averages over the power spectrum of\ndifferent sites. The properties that we use from the QM9 dataset are listed in Table 2. We separate these properties into two categories: (1) the\nground state quantities which are calculated from a single DFT calculation of the molecule and include geometric, energetic, and\nelectronic quantities, and (2) the thermodynamic quantities which are typically calculated from a molecular dynamics simulation.

The objective function then simply picks out the corresponding feature\nfrom the auxiliary information.

Thus, there is likely further room for improvement of the inner optimization loop using more\nsophisticated algorithms, possibly using the gradient information provided by BNNs. Unless otherwise stated, we optimize the inner\nloop of Bayesian optimization to choose the next data point to label by maximizing EI on a pool of |Xpool| = 105randomly sampled\npoints. 8 layers of 256 units or 16 layers of 512 units). 8.6 Continued Training\nAs mentioned in Section 2.3 of the main text, the BNN is ideally trained from scratch until convergence in each iteration loop,\nalthough this comes at a great computational cost. An alternative is the warm restart method of continuing the training from the\nprevious iteration which enables the model \u02d82019s training loss to converge in only a few epochs. This is likely because (a) training does not converge for\nthe new data point Dnew = (xN +1, yN +1) relative to the rest of the data under a limited computational budget, resulting in the\nacquisition function possibly labeling similar points in consecutive iterations, and (b) the BNN gets trapped in a local minima in the\nloss landscape that is not ideal for learning future data points. To mitigate this, we use the cosine annealing learning rate. The large\nlearning rate at the start of training allows the model to more easily escape local minima and explore a multimodal posterior, while\nthe small learning rate towards the end of the annealing cycle allows the model to converge more easily. In particular,\nwe re-train the BNN using 10 epochs. In particular, we use Bayes by Backprop (BBB) (also referred to as the \u02d8201cmean field \u02d8201d\n10approximation), which approximates the posterior over the neural network weights with independent normal distributions. BOHAMIANN proposed to use BNNs in BO by using stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) to approximately\nsample the BNN posterior, combined with scale adaptation to adapt it for an iterative setting. NeuralLinear trains a conventional neural network on the data but then replaces the last layer with Bayesian linear regression such\nthat the neural network serves as an adaptive basis for the linear regression. TuRBO (trust region Bayesian Optimization) is a method that maintains M trust regions and performs Bayesian optimization within\neach trust region, maintaining M local surrogate models, to scale BO to high-dimensional problems that require thousands of\nobservations. We use M = 1 and M = 5, labeled as \u02d8201cTuRBO-1 \u02d8201d and \u02d8201cTuRBO-5 \u02d8201d, respectively. the learning rate momentum is only defined for\nmomentum-based gradient descent methods). We use the implementation provided by the dlib library. DIRECT-L (DIviding RECTangles-Local) systematically divides the search domain into smaller and smaller hyperrectangles to\nefficiently search the space. We use the implementation provided by the NLopt library. We use the implementation provided\nby the pycma library. 8.7.2 Implementation Details\nUnless otherwise stated, we set NMC = 30. Models are trained using the Adam optimizer using the cosine annealing learning rate with a base learning rate of 10 \u02d822123. All\nhidden layers use ReLU as the activation function, and no activation function is applied to the output layer. We use two different types of infinite networks:\n(1)\u02d8201cGP- \u02d8201d refers to a closed-form expression for Gaussian process inference using the infinite-width neural network as\na kernel, and (2) \u02d8201cInf- \u02d8201d refers to an infinite ensemble of infinite-width networks that have been \u02d8201ctrained \u02d8201d with\ncontinuous gradient descent for an infinite time. We compare NNGP and NTK kernels as well as the parameterization of the layers. By default, we use the NTK parameterization, but we also use the standard parameterization, denoted by \u02d8201c-std \u02d8201d. The library optimizes over the acquisition function\nin the inner loop using the L-BFGS algorithm. We use BNNs with 4 hidden layers and 256 units in each hidden layer, where each hidden layer is followed by a ReLU activation\nfunction. Ensembles and\nBBB also perform competitively and much better than random sampling, showing that deep BO is viable even for low-dimensional\nblack-box functions. Also note that the y-axis is\nzoomed in to differentiate the curves. Additionally, KL annealing has the downside of introducing more parameters that must be carefully tuned\nfor optimal performance. MNF performs poorly, especially on the highpass objective where it is comparable to random sampling,\nand we have found that MNF is quite sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters for uncertainty estimates even on simple regression\nproblems. LIPO seems to perform as well as GPs on both objective functions, which is impressive given the computational speed of the LIPO\nalgorithm. While including auxiliary\ninformation clearly improves performance across all architectures, there is not a clear trend of performance with respect to the model\nsize. Orange shaded regions mark the range over which we wish to maximize the scattering. The size of the \u02d8201cFC \u02d8201d architectures are\nchosen to have a similar number of parameters as their convolutional counterparts. Because the pooling layers in the Neural Tangents library are currently\ntoo slow for use in application, we increased the size of the filters to 5 \u02d800d7 5 to increase the receptive field of each filter. Adding convolutional layers and auxiliary information improves performance such that BCNNs significantly outperform GPs. Numbers represent the number of channels and units\nfor the convolutional and fully-connected layers, respectively. All convolutional layers use 3 \u02d800d7 3-sized filters with stride (1, 1)\nand periodic boundaries. \u02d8201cMP \u02d8201d denotes max-pooling layers of size 2 \u02d800d7 2 with stride (2, 2), and \u02d8201cAP \u02d8201d denotes\naverage-pooling layers of size 2 \u02d800d7 2 with stride (1, 1). Note that the DOS has been minimized to nearly zero in a thin frequency range. Orange shaded\nregions mark the frequency range in which we wish to minimize the DOS. To explore more deeply why certain surrogate models perform well while others do not, we track various metrics of the model\nduring BO on a validation dataset with 1000 randomly sampled data points. In particular, we look at the mean squared error (MSE),\nthe mean absolute error (MAE), the negative log-likelihood (NLL), and the calibration error on the PC-A data distribution. The calibration error is a quantitative measure of the uncertainty of the model, which is important for the performance of BO as\nthe acquisition function uses the uncertainty to balance exploration and exploitation. We choose to\nmeasure the error along the confidence levels pj = (j \u02d82212 1)/10 for j = 1, 2, ..., 11. The CDF Fj(yj) an be analytically calculated for\nmodels that have an analytical predictive distribution. We also plot the calibration, (pj, \u02d802c6pj)M j=1, in Figure 13(b). Perfectly calibrated predictions\ncorrespond to a straight line. Interestingly, vanilla GPs have the lowest MSE, so the prediction error is not the only indicator for\nBO performance. Looking at the calibration, the infinite neural network kernel has the highest calibration error, and we see from\nFigure 13(b) that it tends to be overconfident in its predictions. GPs have a higher calibration error than the ensemble neural network\nmethods and tend to be significantly underconfident in their predictions. The ensemble NN methods tend to be reasonably well-calibrated. Within the ensemble NNs, the \"-aux\" methods have lower MSE\nand calibration error than their respective counterparts, and ConvEnsemble-aux has the lowest NLL calibration error out of all the\nmethods, although interestingly Ensemble-aux seems to have the lowest MSE and MAE out of the ensemble NNs. The edge-conditioned graph convolutional layers are implemented by Spektral. \u02d82217 denotes that ybest is measured at N = 100 due\nto computational constraints. Ensembles trained with auxiliary information ( \u02d8201cEnsemble-aux \u02d8201d) and neural linear ( \u02d8201cNeuralLinear \u02d8201d) perform the best\non all objective functions. Adding auxiliary information to ensembles helps for the \u02d803b1 objective function, and neither helps nor\nhurts for the other objective functions. Additionally, BNNs perform at least as well or significantly better than GPs in all cases. The\nV AE-GP benchmark uses the same pre-trained V AE, and \u02d8201cV AE-GP-2 \u02d8201d refers to the same method using a different random\nseed for the V AE. Even with the exact same method, V AE-GP-2 performs significantly worse on both objective functions. We also adjust the\nlearning rate momentum to \u02d803b7 = 0.001 in \u02d8201cV AE-GP-LATENT128-BETA0.001 \u02d8201d, and the latent space dimensionality to 32\nin\u02d8201cV AE-GP-LATENT32 \u02d8201d. The various metrics correlate with the respective methods \u02d82019 performances during BO. Additionally, prior work shows that BBB has trouble scaling to larger network sizes, which may make them\nunsuitable for more complex tasks such as those in our work. BOHAMIANN performs very well on the nanoparticle narrowband\nobjective and comparable to other BNNs without auxiliary information on the nanoparticle highpass objective. This is likely due to\nits effectiveness in exploring a multi-modal posterior. However, the need for SGHMC to sample the posterior makes this method\ncomputationally expensive, and so we were only able to run it for a limited number of iterations using a small neural network\narchitecture. kernel and parameterization), and current implementations of certain operations such as pooling are too\nslow for practical use in an iterative setting. In particular, BO using an infinite ensemble of infinite-width networks performs poorly\ncompared to normal ensembles, suggesting that the infinite-width formulations do not fully capture the dynamics of their finite-width\ncounterparts. Non-Bayesian global optimization methods such as LIPO and DIRECT-L are quite powerful in spite of their small computational\noverhead and can even outperform BO on some simpler tasks. However, they are not as consistent as BO, performing more\ncomparably to random sampling on other tasks. CMA-ES performs poorly on all the tasks here. Also, like GPs, these non-Bayesian\nalgorithms assume a continuous input space and cannot be effectively applied to structured, high-dimensional problems. All training and\ninference using neural network-based models, graph kernels, and infinite-width neural network approximations are carried out on\nthe GPUs.",
        "Results and Findings": "Our findings indicate that neural networks frequently surpass\nGPs as surrogate models for BO in these complex tasks, achieving greater sampling efficiency and reduced\ncomputational expenses. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can significantly outperform GPs as surrogate models on these problems. Another strategy for scaling BO to larger problems involves combining it with other methods, reducing the need for the surrogate\nmodel to train on the entire dataset. However, these approaches still encounter difficulties in encoding complex, structured inputs like images and graphs. We list some notable models\nhere, with model details and results in Section A.4.1 of the Appendix. Ensembles combine multiple models to improve predictive performance by averaging their results. For simplicity, we highlight results from select architectures (see Appendix for\nfull results, dataset, and hyperparameter details). All BO results are averaged over multiple trials, and the shaded area in the plots\nrepresents \u02d800b1 one standard error over the trials. 4The BO results are presented in Figure 2. Within these few iterations, GP-aux performs\npoorly, only slightly better than random sampling. We also find in the Appendix that BO with either GPs or BNNs is comparable\nwith or outperforms other global optimization algorithms, including DIRECT-L and CMA-ES. The BO results, shown in Figure 4(a), demonstrate that BCNNs outperform GPs by a significant margin on both datasets. Because\nGP-aux is extremely expensive compared to GP (500 \u02d800d7 longer on this dataset), we are only able to run GP-aux for a small\nnumber of iterations, where it performs comparably to random sampling. As shown in Figure 4(c), we indeed find that data augmentation improves the BO performance of the translation-\ndependent architecture when trained on the translation-invariant PC-A dataset, even matching the performance of a translation-\ninvariant architecture on PC-A. These results show that techniques used\nto improve generalization performance (such as data augmentation or invariant architectures) for training deep learning architectures\ncan also be applied to BO surrogate models and, when used appropriately, directly translate into improved BO performance. 5Here, we focus on the QM9 dataset, which consists of 133,885 small organic molecules along with their geometric, electronic,\nand thermodynamic quantities calculated with DFT. In the case of maximizing the polarizability\n\u02d803b1, including the auxiliary information improves BO performance, showing signs of positive transfer. The results for this experiment show that V AE-GP performs worse than BNNs on two of the three objective functions we tested and\nslightly better on one objective. Interestingly, GP-aux performs extremely poorly on the nanoparticle and photonic crystal tasks. For example, we have noticed that larger batch sizes tend to significantly hurt BO performance. All our results use continued training (or warm restart) to minimize training costs. When comparing BNN architectures, we find that ensembles tend to consistently perform among the best, which is supported by\nprevious literature showing that ensembles capture uncertainty much better than variational methods, especially in multi-modal loss\nlandscapes. We have demonstrated that integrating\ndomain knowledge on the structure and symmetries of the data into the surrogate model, as well as exploiting intermediate or\nauxiliary information, significantly improves BO performance, all of which can be interpreted as physics-informed priors.

We also extract the group velocities at each k-point and compute the density-of-states (DOS) via an\nextrapolative technique. We can see in Figure 6 that increasing |Xpool| in the acquisition step\ntends to improve BO performance. However, as shown in Figure 7, we\nhave found that naive continued training can result in poor BO performance. Infinite-width neural networks are implemented using the Neural Tangents library. 8.8 Additional Results\n8.8.1 Test Functions\nWe test BO on several common synthetic functions used for optimization, namely the Branin and 6-dimensional Hartmann functions. Plots of the best value ybest at each BO iteration are shown in Figure 8.

Note that results using\nauxiliary information are denoted by a solid line, while those that do not are denoted by a dashed line. We also experiment with KL annealing in BBB, a proposed method to improve the performance of variational methods for BNNs in\nwhich the weight of the KL term in the loss function is slowly increased throughout training. For these experiments, we exponentially\nanneal the KL term with weight \u02d803c3KL(i) = 10i/500 \u02d822125 as a function of epoch i when training from scratch; during the continued\ntraining, the weight is held constant at \u02d803c3KL = 10 \u02d822123. KL annealing in the BBB architecture significantly improves performance for the narrowband objective, although results are mixed\nfor the highpass objective. The different variants infinite-width neural networks do not perform as well as the BNNs on both objective functions, despite the\nhyperparameter search. Interestingly DIRECT-L does not perform as well as LIPO or GPs on the narrowband objective, and actually performs\ncomparably to random sampling on the highpass objective. Additionally, CMA performs poorly on both objectives, likely due to the\nhighly multimodal nature of the objective function landscape. All results are ensembles, and \u02d8201caux \u02d8201d denotes using auxiliary information. We can see that the\nscattering spectra peak in the shaded region of interest, as desired by the respective objective functions. Unless otherwise stated, all results in the main\ntext and here use the \u02d8201cConv-TI \u02d8201d and \u02d8201cFC \u02d8201d architectures for BCNNs and BNNs, respectively. Detailed BO results for the PC problem are shown in Table 5. DIRECT-L and CMA perform extremely well on the PC-A distribution but performs worse than GP on the PC-B distribution. Interestingly, the infinite-width networks perform extremely poorly, although this may be due to a lack of pooling layers in their\narchitecture which limits the receptive field of the convolutions.

        "Methodology": "Existing techniques often neglect detailed structural\ninformation, focusing mainly on contextual information. We addressed this issue\nby developing k-mer embeddings that combine contextual and structural string\ninformation, by enriching De Bruijn graphs with structural similarity connections. We also crafted a self-supervised method using Contrastive Learning, employing a\nheterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network encoder and constructing positive\npairs based on node similarities. 1 Introduction\nGenomic sequence data is growing at an unprecedented rate, requiring the development of novel\nmethods that can provide both accurate and scalable sequence representations. These NLP-based approaches\nare effective at capturing the context within a sequence, which is important because the semantics of\nwords often outweigh their precise letters. However, a uniform\nrepresentation of each n-gram across all sequences can oversimplify the problem. Applying techniques\nlike transformer-based models on n-grams can escalate computational demands. Consequently, these\nmethods may overlook nuanced k-mer variations important for understanding single-nucleotide\npolymorphisms and other minor sequence changes. Therefore, we developed a k-mer embedding approach that combines metagenomic context and string\nstructure. In our method, contextual information refers to the relationships between k-mers closely\nsituated within sequences, and structural information examines nucleotide patterns within a k-mer\nand their relations to other k-mers. We constructed a metagenomic graph that builds upon the De\nBruijn Graph to capture k-mer transitions and structural similarities. Given the advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we grounded our method in GNNs but\ndesigned for heterogeneous graphs. This approach effectively recognizes and uses both contextual\nand structural connection types. Drawing from the success of self-supervised pre-training in NLP\nand Computer Vision, we designed a self-supervised objective for genomic graph data. We employed\ncontrastive loss aiming to align k-mers with similar context and structure in representation space. The former estimates the minimum changes needed to transform one genomic\nsequence into another, avoiding quadratic computational complexity. .2 Related Work\n2.1 Genomic Sequence Representation\nMachine learning methods have emerged in computational biology to represent genomic sequences. This method underpins GRaDL for early\nanimal genome disease detection. K-mers also pair well with transformer-based models: DNABERT\nleverages a BERT-inspired objective and k-mer tokenization to predict genome-wide regulatory\nelements. Because we aim\nto enhance our node embeddings with structural similarity, both heterogeneity and heterophily are\nkey considerations. These networks expand upon GCNs by generalizing the convolution\noperation to handle different edge types. To tackle heterophily, where distant nodes in a graph may\nbear similar features, Geom-GCN maps nodes to a latent space, while another approach suggests a\ndistinct encoding approach for node embeddings and neighborhood aggregations. At its\ncore, contrastive learning seeks to bring similar data instances closer in the embedding space while\npushing dissimilar ones apart. When applied to graph data, several techniques have been proposed\nfor obtaining positive pairs, including uniform sampling, node dropping, and random walk sampling. 3 Methodology\n3.1 Metagenomic Graph\nThe De Bruijn Graph, which is created from metagenomic sequences, forms the basis of our method. In this graph, each k-mer, a substring of length k from the sequences, is represented by a different\nnode. When used, edge weights represent the frequency of these transitions, capturing genomic structures\nwithin the graph. Although Node2Vec captures the sequential context in De Bruijn graphs, it overlooks structural k-mer\nsimilarities. To address this, we expand the graph to include connections based on these similarities. Let\nT(vi, vj)be the count of transitions between k-mers within a dataset of genomic sequences. The\nweight of an edge connecting nodes viandvj,w(dBG )\nij , is defined by,\nw(dBG )\nij =T(vi,vj)P\nvk\u2208\u03b4+(vi)T(vi,vk)\nwhere \u03b4+(vi)denotes nodes adjacent to vivia outgoing edges. 2Sub-k-mer Frequency edges To capture the structural similarity between strings, we introduce\na method using sub-k-mer frequency vectors, denoted as y(KFsub_k). This vector quantifies the\noccurrences of each sub-k-mer of length sub_kwithin a given k-mer. The i-th entry indicates the\nfrequency of the i-th sub-k-mer,\ny(KFsub_k)[i] =Pk\u2212sub_k+1\nj=1I[kmer [j:j+sub_k\u22121] =si]\u2200si, s\u2208Psub_k\nThe k-mer similarity is determined by the cosine similarity between the sub-k-mer frequency vectors,\nw(KFsub_k)\nij =y(KFsub_k)\niTy(KFsub_k)\nj\n||y(KFsub_k)\ni||2||y(KFsub_k)\nj||2\nThis method, scaling linearly with the frequency vector size per weight, provides a computational\nadvantage over the direct Edit Distance calculation for k-mers. We apply edge-filtering at threshold t,\nretaining only the links with the highest similarity. The filtered set of weights is then,\nW(KFsub_k)={w(KFsub_k)\nij |w(KFsub_k)\nij \u2265t}\nTo accommodate graphs for larger k values, we have developed a more scalable approximation of the\nabove approach. It utilizes approximate nearest neighbor search on the sub-k-mer frequency vectors,\nwhich replaces the computationally demanding pairwise cosine similarity calculations. Nodes Vcorrespond to individual k-mers. The edges Ecan be categorized into two sets: De Bruijn Graphs\u2019s edges E(dBG )and Sub-k-mer\nFrequency edges E(KF). 3.3 Self-Supervised Task\nWe use a contrastive learning method for k-mer representations. Graph nodes are initialized using\na sub-k-mer frequency vector. Positive and negative pairs are sampled and, along with the k-mer\nrepresentations from the encoder, are used to compute the loss. This approach uses w(dBG )edges to conduct walks, implemented exactly\nas in Node2Vec. Given a walk of a set length, we extract positive pairs by applying a window of\nsizem. Using a shrink factor \u03b4, drawn uniformly from 1, ..., m , we determine the range i\u00b1\u03b4within\nwhich nodes are considered positive pairs to node vi. Repeating this across multiple random walks,\nwe gather a comprehensive set of positive pairs. Structural Similarity Sampling To capture the structural notion of k-mers, we sample pairs with\nprobability proportional to sub-k-mer frequency similarity, w(KFsub_k). The goal is for k-mers linked\nby higher similarity to have similar representations. The probability of sampling is given by,\nP(vi, vj)\u221dw(KFsub_k)\nij\nNegative Sampling We randomly select negative pairs from all node pairs in the graph, leveraging\nthe assumption that most pairs lack a high similarity edge. This approach ensures diversity in learned\nrepresentations. 3Loss Function Having established both positive ( Ppos) and negative ( Pneg) pair types, we apply the\ncontrastive loss function. Using \u03c3(x)as the sigmoid function, the loss function is:\nlij=\u2212log(\u03c3(zT\nizj))\u2212P\n(vi,vl)\u2208Pneglog(1\u2212\u03c3(zT\nizl))\nTo reduce memory usage, we employed Neighborhood Sampling for mini-batching during training. The NeuroSEED framework\noffers a solution using sequence representations trained on a ground truth set of edit distances. In our\napproach, we began with sequence representations derived from k-mer embeddings and fine-tuned\nthem with a single linear layer. Based on previous work, we used the hyperbolic function. For performance assessment, we used top-n percent accuracies, measuring how often the actual\nsequence appears within the top n percent of positions based on the closeness of embedding vectors\nin hyperbolic space. We selected the optimal model for the embeddings based on the validation loss\nobserved for the previous Edit Distance task. When pre-training exclusively on the training set,\nour method, thanks to the GCN encoder, can generalize beyond k-mers present in the training set. Therefore, for k > 6, where the test set introduces new k-mers, we excluded these methods. In this context, our method\u2019s integration of k-mer structural similarity\nbecomes even more beneficial, outperforming all other tested methods. This benefit becomes more\nevident as k increases, underscoring our embedding\u2019s capability to adapt to new nodes. The superior zero-shot\nnon-parametric retrieval performance of our CL method emphasizes the combined utility of both\ncontext and structural similarity during self-supervised pre-training. Our method based solely on zero-shot concatenated k-\nmer embeddings outperforms this complex fine-tuning.",
        "Results and Findings": "Our embeddings consistently outperform prior\nmethods for Edit Distance Approximation and Closest String Retrieval tasks. These SNPs can influence disease susceptibility,\nphenotypic traits, and drug responses. A key component is the k-mer: a continuous nucleotide sequence of length k. The Word2Vec method,\nwhich represents words as vectors using their context, treats overlapping k-mers in genomic sequences\nas words in sentences. Metagenome2Vec blends Node2Vec with transformers to analyze metagenomes with\nlimited labeled data. De Bruijn Graph\u2019s edges The first edge type is designed to capture contextual information. Biased Random Walk Sampling We employ Biased Random Walk Sampling to capture k-mer\ncontextual information. Our experiments were tested against One-Hot encoding (for k =\n1), Word2Vec, and Node2Vec. To find optimal hyperparameters, we executed a grid search on\nthe validation set. We assessed embeddings\nfine-tuned on the edit distance approximation task using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 5 Results and Analysis\nIn all our experiments, the memory requirements of the One-Hot method increased exponentially,\nleading to its exclusion from our results for k > 7. 5.1 Edit Distance Approximation\nTable 1 presents the results obtained by using our pre-trained embeddings to estimate edit distances\nbetween sequences on the RT988 and Qiita datasets. For the RT988 dataset, our Contrastive Learning\n(CL) and Node2Vec techniques surpassed Word2Vec and One-Hot. 5.2 Closest String Retrieval\nTables 2a and 2b present the performance of our zero-shot sequence embeddings, directly derived\nfrom the aggregation of our k-mer embeddings, in retrieving the nearest sequences in the Qiita dataset. 4For direct k-mer aggregation, our Contrastive Learning (CL) embeddings are obtained through\nconcatenation, while for k-mer aggregation with One-Hot, Word2Vec, and Node2Vec, we report the\nresults of the better performing method, either concatenation or averaging. Notably, while k-mers of size\naround three are optimal for Top 1 percent retrieval, larger k-mers excel in the Top 10 percent metrics. This suggests that smaller k-mers are better at discerning local sequence distances, while larger ones\ncapture broader sequence distances. In the Edit Distance Approximation task, our technique con-\nsistently demonstrated superior performance compared to One-Hot, Word2Vec, and Node2Vec. Moreover, without requiring any downstream fine-tuning, our aggregated k-mer embeddings outper-\nformed the prior method in the Closest String Retrieval task. These findings suggest potential broader\nuses in computational biology.",
        "Conclusion": "Finally, we tested our technique on two downstream tasks: Edit Distance Approximation and Closest\nString Retrieval. This shows the advantage of our embeddings\nover the method by previous work. 6 Conclusion\nIn our study, we introduced a novel k-mer embedding technique that seamlessly integrates metage-\nnomic contextual and structural nuances, achieved through the enhancement of the De Bruijn graph\nand the use of contrastive learning. 5"

        "Abstract": "Multi-Agent Systems Control Using Graph Neural\nNetworks with Model-Based Reinforcement Learning\nAbstract\nMulti-agent systems (MAS) play a crucial role in the advancement of machine\nintelligence and its applications.",
        "Methodology": "This model employs a\nstate-space Graph Neural Network alongside Model-based Reinforcement Learning\nto tackle MAS tasks, such as Billiard-Avoidance and Autonomous Driving. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control, enhanced by the Cross-Entropy\nMethod (CEM), is used to guide the ego-agent\u2019s action planning, facilitating\nsuccessful completion of MAS tasks. Additionally, it\nis widely acknowledged that learning policies from physical state-based characteristics is significantly\nmore effective and straightforward than learning from visual pixels. Therefore, this research focused\non learning control policies from states and exploring the use of a graph neural network (GNN)\ndynamics model to predict future states in multi-agent systems. We then utilized a Cross-Entropy\nMethod (CEM)-optimized model-based controller for motion planning of the ego-agent, which\nenabled successful execution of specific MAS missions. We begin by developing and testing our\n\"GNN for MBRL\" model on a MAS billiard avoidance scenario to investigate the possibilities of\nGNNs and model-based RL. We aim to transfer the framework to real-world self-driving applications. Recognizing the capabilities of GNNs in\nphysical systems, we can utilize GNN-based reasoning to represent objects as nodes and relations\nas edges, which allows for an effective approach to analyzing objects and relations. The latent positions and velocities of\nmultiple agents act as the connection between the two components. The model uses simple uniform\nand Gaussian distributions to initialize the states. The STOVE model is trained on video sequences\nby maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO). STOVE has also extended their video model\ninto reinforcement learning (RL) tasks for planning. Inspired by\nthese RL experiments, we apply the GNN model directly to states rather than complex visual data\nto improve sample efficiency and predict agents\u2019 future states. In the experiment, we train\nthe GNN dynamics model using ground truth states of video sequence data for multi-agent systems\ninstead of visual data. Model-based Reinforcement Learning . Model-based RL is considered a solution to the high\nsample complexity of model-free RL. This method typically includes two primary steps: (1) creating\na dynamics model that predicts future states based on present states and actions, and (2) using a\nplanning method to learn a global policy and act in the environment effectively. 2 Method\n2.1 Framework\nThe \"GNN for MBRL\" method consists of two primary stages: (1) a GNN dynamics model training\nphase, using offline recorded video sequences or low-dimensional states for video prediction, and\n(2) a motion planning phase using CEM-based Model Predictive Control (MPC). This involves a\nfeedback control algorithm with a Cross-Entropy Method optimizer to interact with the billiard\nenvironment. The aim is to plan effective actions for the ego-agent in order to avoid collisions. Subsequently,\nthe trained model is integrated into the model-based RL section to control the ego agent for motion\nplanning. It is possible to combine the previously trained GNN model with MPC to assess if\nthis method can successfully address MAS tasks. A negative reward is given when the red ball hits another. 1000 sequences\n2of length 100 for training and 300 sequences of length 100 for testing were generated using a random\naction selection policy. The pixel resolution was 32*32 with the ball mass set to 2.0. Similar to the discrete setting, continuous datasets were produced with random actions from a uniform\ndistribution within (-2, 2). These datasets included the image observations, actions, states, dones,\nand rewards. The average rewards for the continuous mode are lower, indicating more frequent\ninteractions between the balls. Data Mode Action space Actions dtype Average Rewards of training data Average Rewards of testing data\nDiscrete 9 One-hot mode -17.276 -16.383\nContinuous 2 Numpy array -18.93 -18.71\n2.3 GNN Dynamics Model Training\nWe used supervised learning to train on ground-truth states rather than high-dimensional image data. The aim is to improve sample efficiency, then combine the trained model with CEM-optimized MPC\nfor predicting future states. The model can learn to predict future states of multiple agents instead of\nfirst extracting the states from visual data with a separate model. Training was performed for 500\nepochs, and the model parameters were saved. The GNN model could work on both action space 2 and 9 discrete\nactions without changing the GNN network architecture, resulting in a unified training framework. 2.4 GNN with MBRL\nFollowing traditional Model-based RL, the trained GNN model was combined with CEM-optimized\nMPC to assess performance on the continuous gym-billiard avoidance task. The saved GNN model\npredicts future states, and the MPC searches for optimal actions for the ego-agent. The search is\nrepeated after each step to account for prediction errors and rewards, incorporating feedback from the\nenvironment. For the continuous case, the GNN dynamics model was combined with CEM optimized MPC and\ncompared with random and ground truth scenarios. Both conditions were trained for 500 epochs. The Supervised condition took less time to train than\nthe Action-conditioned case. However, the continuous reward error decreased from 0.48 to 0, while the discrete one\ndropped from 0.16 to 0. Position and velocity\nprediction errors decreased during training. The continuous V_error dropped from 0.65 to 0.05,\nwhile the discrete one decreased from 0.07 to 0.01. The four metrics met the criteria for a reasonable\nGNN dynamics model for the subsequent RL task. Reconstruction\nerrors were always zero since no image reconstruction was used on the true states. The discrete case\nshowed a better performance compared to the continuous case with respect to the \"Prediction_error\". Thus, the trained Supervised RL model can be used for the following\nmodel-based RL phase. During MCTS, the GNN model predicted future sequences for 100 parallel environments with the\nlength of 100, using a maximal rollout depth of 10. For the continuous datasets, we combined the trained GNN model into the CEM optimized MPC\nmethod and compared it with random and ground truth cases. The GNN model made accurate\npredictions based on the current states by checking the code, changing the cuda device and data type.",
        "Results and Findings": "Empirical evidence demonstrates that an actor\nusing Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) on top of STOVE is comparable to model-free techniques,\nsuch as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), while needing a fraction of the samples. The STOVE model\nuses Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) to develop a policy based on the world model, which acts as a\nplanning simulator, and found that MCTS combined with STOVE could outperform the model-free\nPPO algorithm in a multi-billiards avoidance task. After training, MPC uses a model to predict future outputs of a process. We obtained\nthe avoidance sequences datasets using the \"generate_billiards_w_actions\" function. We also conducted experiments on discrete datasets using MCTS and saved videos. 3 Results\n3.1 GNN Training Results\nThe datasets generated from the gym-billiard API environment, including image observations, actions,\nstates, dones, and rewards, were stored in pickle files. A notable finding is that the GNN model worked equally well for both\naction space 2 and 9 discrete actions without changing the original GNN architecture. The continuous position error was close to the discrete,\n3but the velocity error showed a greater difference. Generated rollout videos indicated that the ego-red ball performed reasonably\nwell in avoiding collisions. We changed the mass of the ball agents to 1.0 and 2.0 and trained two GNN dynamics models. We then calculated the mean collision rate and\nsaved 100 videos to show the ego-ball\u2019s interaction with other agents, which demonstrates improved\ncollision avoidance and lower collision rates. We computed the \"reward,\" the average collisions per epoch, for each method. The\nperformance of our proposed method was better than random cases, and the results of \"GNN_MPC\"\nwere close to the \"Ground_truth\" case, which indicated that the trained GNN dynamics model predicts\nthe future states of multi-object systems as well as the ground truth interactive environment. We also conducted experiments on the \"Action-conditioned\" case with MCTS using discrete datasets\nand explored the \"Supervised RL\" GNN dynamics model with CEM-optimized MPC on continuous\ndatasets. The proposed model predicted video sequences well and controlled the ego-agent to address\nRL tasks, which may be applied to complex multi-agent systems like the gym-carla autonomous\ndriving environment.",
        "Conclusion": "Therefore, we established a continuous version of the multi-billiard environment for\ndata collection. 4 Conclusions\nWe introduced the \"GNN for MBRL\" concept, combining a graph neural network (GNN) dynamics\nmodel with CEM-optimized Model Predictive Control (MPC) on a gym-billiard avoidance MAS task. 4"

        "Abstract": "An Empathetic AI Painter: A System for\nComputational Creativity Through Embodied\nConversational Interaction\nAbstract\nThis paper presents an investigation into the computational modeling of the creative\nprocess of a portrait artist, focusing on the incorporation of human traits like per-\nsonality and emotions into the artistic process. An artist has several options in themes, brush style, color\nplan, edge and line plan, abstraction style, and emotional narrative to achieve the finished artwork. It aims to understand the sitter\u2019s traits, such as personality and\nemotions, to create a unique portrait by selecting the appropriate abstraction techniques, color palette,\nand style that correspond to those traits.",
        "Methodology": "The system includes an empathetic\nconversational component to discern the dominant personality traits of the user,\nand this information is then utilized by a generative AI portraiture module to create\na personalized stylization of the user\u2019s portrait. Although there are differences between art and science regarding their goals and\ntoolsets, these distinctions blur when artists use scientific understanding to inform their work and\nscience examines art to comprehend the human experience. This process includes the\narrangement of the environment, placement of the subject, and an interview to grasp their mental\nand physical characteristics. The system operates in a two-stage process; the first stage\ninvolves capturing the characteristics of the sitter, followed by the second stage, which uses the\ncaptured traits to generate a stylized artistic representation of their portrait. The initial stage of\ncapturing the personality of the sitter occurs during the conversation with an embodied conversational\nagent, using empathetic interaction methods. This system utilizes the M-Path conversational agent,\nwhich has been developed previously. The M-Path system was modified for this demonstration to\nconduct an interview based on the Big-5 personality questionnaire to categorize the sitter into one\nof the established personality dimensions. This data is then used to map the personality traits to a\nparticular artistic style. The mapping is transferred to the Generative AI Portrait Stylization system in\n.the second stage, which creates an artistic portrait. First, a portrait of the sitter is captured under controlled lighting conditions, and a unique ID is\nassigned after consent is provided for participation and use of the portrait. The M-Path system uses the data collected to classify the sitter\u2019s personality\ninto a specific dimension. The generated portraits are showcased on a monitor for all\nparticipants and the crowd to observe and assess. This model\nclassifies personality variations across five dimensions: extraversion, openness, conscientiousness,\nneuroticism, and agreeableness. Each of these dimensions encompasses a wide range of psychological\nfunctions, which are composed of more specific traits. The questionnaire\nused is a shortened version of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, which has 120 questions\nand takes 45 minutes to complete. For the online demonstration, one statement for each dimension\nwas used, where the whole conversational interaction could be completed in under 5 minutes. Each\nquestion is further modified to align with the conversation setup in the demonstration environment. Do you trust me in sharing how you feel? The answers to these questions are evaluated for their polarity and then mapped onto two-factor\ndimensions for personality adjectives. These traits may be either negative or positive. The mapping from\nBig-5 traits to the Generative AI portrait styles was provided by art experts who independently\nmapped the styles to the Big-5 categories and reached an agreement. The interaction involves a face-to-face conversation with a human interaction partner,\n2similar to a video-conference with audio and visual input and output. The agent processes the\nreal-time inputs in terms of their linguistic and affective properties to generate empathetic verbal\nand non-verbal behavior. This process was triggered with a push-to-talk system. M-Path enters a listening state when the\nuser speaks. During the listening state, speech and facial expressions are processed in real-time for\nspeech and emotion recognition. The video input is used in the facial emotion recognition module,\nwhich uses an OpenCV face-recognition algorithm to identify the face. Emotions are categorized\nusing a CNN model, trained on the CK+ Dataset, into 6 basic emotion categories. The speech\ninput is sent to the speech-to-text module which uses a service to get streaming speech recognition. The text is sent to the decision-making module for creating\nconversational responses. The information is then sent to the decision-making module, and the agent enters a\nthinking state. This is done by analyzing the user\u2019s\nemotional response from the listening state. The listening,\nthinking, and speaking states of the agent loop until the user is categorized. During the listening\nstage, the agent shows a non-verbal affect matching response and backchanneling behavior. These behaviors are combined to create an empathic listening behavior. The DM\ncompletes the Big-5 personality questionnaire to assign a personality category. The EM ensures that\nthe DM generates empathetic responses while reaching its goal. The DM gathers the appropriate\nemotional response from the EM to generate an emotionally appropriate verbal reaction to the user,\nfollowed by a survey-related coping response, and then the next survey question. The Big-5 questionnaire answers are collected to select the\nmost dominant personality dimensions of the user, based on their probability values and polarity. After each response is generated\nby the dialogue manager, it is sent to the behavior manager to be performed by the conversational\nagent during the speaking state. To achieve a natural conversation, the system continuously produces\nnon-verbal and verbal behaviors. Lip movements, facial expressions, head gestures, body gestures,\nand posture are synchronized with the agent\u2019s speech. The animation is sent as a BML message to\nthe Smartbody character animation platform, to display the generated behaviors. The first phase preprocesses the original portrait\nby using an AI tool to separate the foreground from the background, which will be used to stylize\nthe portrait. Then, the light and color balance of the face are adjusted to achieve a lighting effect,\nwhere one side of the face is dramatically shown. The next phase uses this image and the personality\ncategory as inputs to a modified Deep Dream (mDD) system with multiple passes on the image to\ncreate the base style. While most DD systems use pre-trained networks with object recognition data,\nthe modified system uses artistic paintings and drawings as training data. The system has a dataset of\n160,000 labeled and categorized paintings from 3000 artists. The ePainterly system combines Deep Style techniques as a surface\ntexture manipulator, and a series of Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) techniques like particle\nsystems, color palette manipulation, and stroke engine techniques. This iterative process enhances\n3the portrait, and the final result is shown in an online gallery. This additional step reduces noise artifacts from\nthe mDD output, creates cohesive stroke-based clustering, and a better distributed color space. Forty-two participants\ntested the system, with 26 of them completing the portrait-taking and interaction.",
        "Results and Findings": "The paper details the system and\nthe outcomes of real-time interactions from a demonstration session. Artists also aim to convey their individual painting style while trying\nto express personal and universal ideas. Individuals high in conscientiousness tend to be organized,\nplan-oriented, and determined. Individuals scoring high on neuroticism tend\nto experience negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, impulsiveness, self-consciousness,\nvulnerability, anger, hostility and worry. Individuals with high scores in agreeableness are characterized as trusting,\ncaring, forgiving, altruistic, flexible, gullible, good-natured, soft-hearted, cooperative and tolerant. The perceptual module gathers the video and audio signals when the conversation partner is speaking. Sentiment analysis evaluates the text for its polarity using the SO-CAL Sentiment Analyzer, which\nwas trained on the NRC-Canada lexicon. The conversation begins with the user\u2019s greeting and\nfinishes when the agent receives suitable answers to the personality survey questions. The\nBig-5 mapping is used to select a category for the user, with adjectives. On average, 84.72\n4",
        "Conclusion": "The sitter initiates\nthe interaction until a complete conversation is concluded and the agent informs the sitter that the\ninteraction has ended. This process continues until the partner finishes speaking, which concludes\nthe listening state. After\nthe conversation with the participant ends, the final text received and the user\u2019s overall sentiment are\nsent to the Dialogue Manager (DM), and ultimately to the Empathy Mechanisms (EM). In the last phase, the source image from the previous phase is further enhanced\nusing the personality category. The NPR subclass of stroke-based rendering is used as the final part of the process to realize\nthe internal mDD models with stroke-based output. 3 Conclusion\nThe Empathic AI Painter was presented at a conference demonstration session."

Typically, task\ninstructions are implicitly understood rather than explicitly stated.",
        "Methodology": "This sets the\nstage for exploring research in large multimodal models (LMMs) that are fine-tuned\nwith instructions. Subsequently, the foundational aspects of instruction tuning in\nlarge language models are covered, which is a method that is further adapted to\nthe multimodal domain. Additionally, a review of newly developing areas in this field is presented. These visual and linguistic components can be interconnected through\nan adaptable module. The training methodology typically involves employing an auto-regressive loss on the generated text\ntokens. GIT utilizes an image encoder from a contrastive\npre-trained model and builds a language model independently. Conversely, BLIP2 maintains the\npre-trained image and language models in a fixed state while incorporating a trainable Querying\nTransformer (Q-former), demonstrating efficiency through a unique bootstrapping technique. It includes a Perceiver Sampler to streamline\ncomputational demands and a Gated Transformer to enhance stability during the early training phase. Flamingo is trained on a diverse mix of large-scale multimodal data sourced exclusively from the web,\nbypassing the need for conventionally annotated machine learning datasets. A standout feature of Flamingo is its capability for multimodal in-context learning. 2.3 OpenAI Multimodal GPT-4 and Research Gaps\nReleased in March 2023, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 showcases advanced capabilities in understanding and\nreasoning with visual data. Although specifics of the model remain undisclosed, its ability to facilitate\nnew applications is evident from highlighted examples in technical reports. For instance, it can\ndiscern unusual elements within images and demonstrate sophisticated reasoning across text and\nimages. Key observations are: (i) GPT-2 serves as the auto-\nregressive equivalent in the era dominated by BERT\u2019s pre-training then fine-tuning paradigm. This model represents a shift from fine-tuning model weights to utilizing prompts for broader\ngeneralization and reduced adaptation costs. (iv) GPT-4 not only enhances previous\nmodels\u2019 language capabilities but also incorporates visual inputs for comprehension and reasoning. This enables the training of a single model capable of handling multiple tasks\n2with clear directives. The exposure to varied task instructions and examples during training allows\nthe model to generalize to novel tasks through task composition during inference. 3.2 Self-Instruct and Open-Source LLMs\nThe collection of a wide array of high-quality instruction-following data can be achieved through\ntwo primary methods: human-human interaction and human-machine interaction. The former is\nresource-intensive, involving human task providers and annotators, while the latter involves machines\nor models performing the annotation tasks under human guidance. Self-Instruct tuning represents a streamlined and potent method for aligning LLMs with human\nintent, utilizing instruction-following data produced by leading teacher LLMs. This technique,\nwhich leverages the in-context learning capability of LLMs, has significantly enhanced the zero- and\nfew-shot generalization abilities of LLMs. The iterative process, as illustrated in Figure 9, involves\nhumans providing initial examples, which the LLM then uses to generate further instructions and\nresponses, refining the dataset iteratively. 4 Instructed Tuned Large Multimodal Models\nThis section describes the development of a minimal multimodal GPT-4 model using open-source\ntools, with a focus on the LLaV A model, and a similar approach in the MiniGPT-4 project. 4.1 Open-Source Prototypes: LLaVA / MiniGPT4\nInspired by successful concepts in NLP, we apply the self-instruct methodology from language\nprocessing to the vision-and-language domain. A significant challenge is the absence of a robust\nmultimodal teacher model. Thus, we explore how language-only models like GPT-4 can generate\nmultimodal instruction-following data. LLaV A integrates a pre-trained\nCLIP ViT-L/14 visual encoder with the Vicuna large language model via a projection matrix. ** Both the projection matrix and the LLM are fine-tuned to cater to various application\nscenarios. Empirical evidence suggests that adjusting only the linear projection\nlayer is adequate for conversational scenarios, although it necessitates longer training periods. - **PandaGPT**: A comprehensive model designed to\nadhere to instructions across various modalities [41]. - **X-LLM**:\nAdvances large language models by conceptualizing multi-modalities as different languages [4]. Although there is considerable diversity in the types of models, the fundamental concept of integrating\nmultiple modalities is consistent with the approach used in LMMs, which augment LLMs with visual\ncapabilities. - **mPlug-OWL**: Utilizes modularization to enrich large\nlanguage models with multimodality, thereby improving their versatility [58]. - **M3IT**: A comprehensive\ndataset designed for multi-modal multilingual instruction tuning, facilitating the development of\nmodels that can understand and generate content across different languages and modalities [22]. - **MetaVL**: Focuses on transferring the in-context learning ability from language models to\nvision-language models, enabling them to perform tasks based on contextual examples without prior\ntraining [30]. - **QLoRA**: Introduces\na method for efficient fine-tuning of quantized LLMs, significantly reducing the memory footprint\nrequired for training large models [7]. -\n**Evaluating Object Hallucination**: Addresses the challenge of object hallucination in large\nvision-language models, providing a framework for assessing and mitigating this issue [23]. - **LVLM-eHub**:\nPresents a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for assessing the capabilities of large vision-language\nmodels across a variety of tasks [56]. - **PMC-VQA**: Focuses on visual instruction\ntuning for medical visual question answering, demonstrating the applicability of LMMs in healthcare\n[63]. The open-source community has rapidly produced a range of models and prototypes that introduce\na variety of new functionalities. Additionally, GILL has broadened the capabilities of LMMs to include\ncomprehensive image generation, a feature not currently present in GPT-4. From the standpoint of\nintroducing basic versions of new multimodal features, the open-source community is seemingly on\npar with OpenAI\u2019s Multimodal GPT-4, taking initial steps toward developing a versatile multimodal\nassistant. This demands significantly greater computational power and more sophisticated\nlanguage models, which are generally not accessible to most individuals. It has revisited the concept of instruction tuning in large language models (LLMs)\nand demonstrated the steps to construct a basic model akin to LLaV A and MiniGPT4 with open-source\ntools. The paper also proposes future directions for community-driven efforts. It suggests that entities with\nsubstantial resources should concentrate on scaling existing capabilities and exploring new emergent\nproperties. Meanwhile, others can focus on creating prototypes for new features, developing evalua-\ntion methods, and devising strategies to lower computational demands, thereby making advanced\nmodel computation more widely accessible. While we aimed to cover the\nrelevant literature up to June 19, 2023, the rapid evolution of LMM research may mean that some\ncontributions have been unintentionally omitted.",
        "Results and Findings": "Within the Transformer framework, image tokens have the capability to interact with one\nanother, and each text token is influenced by the preceding text tokens and all image tokens.

        "Abstract": "Improving Random Forests through Random Splitting\nAbstract\nTo enhance the accuracy and scalability of decision tree algorithms, we introduce a\ngeneralization called Top-k.",
        "Methodology": "This approach considers the top kfeatures as potential\nsplits at each step, rather than the single best feature, offering a trade-off between\nthe simplicity of greedy algorithms and the accuracy of optimal decision trees. The\ncore idea is to explore a wider range of potential splits at each node, mitigating\nthe risk of early commitment to suboptimal choices inherent in traditional greedy\napproaches. This exploration is controlled by the parameter k, allowing for a\nflexible balance between computational cost and predictive performance. Larger\nvalues of klead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy but\nincreasing computational complexity. Conversely, smaller values of kprioritize\nefficiency, sacrificing some accuracy for speed. However, traditional greedy algorithms like ID3, C4.5, and\nCART [1, 2] suffer from limitations in accuracy and scalability, particularly when dealing with\nhigh-dimensional datasets. These algorithms typically select the single best feature for splitting at\neach node, a process that can be susceptible to noise and prone to suboptimal choices early in the\ntree construction. This inherent greediness can lead to shallow trees with limited predictive power,\nespecially when relevant features are masked by irrelevant ones. The computational cost, while\ngenerally manageable for smaller datasets, can also become prohibitive for larger-scale applications. Instead of\nselecting only the single best feature at each node, Top-k considers the top kfeatures as potential split\ncandidates. This approach allows for a more thorough exploration of the feature space, mitigating\nthe risk of early commitment to suboptimal splits. The parameter kprovides a flexible control\nmechanism: larger values of klead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy\nbut increasing computational complexity, while smaller values prioritize efficiency at the cost of\nsome accuracy. This trade-off allows practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and\ncomputational resources. By considering multiple top features, Top-k reduces the probability of selecting an irrelevant or noisy\nfeature early in the tree construction. This is particularly beneficial in high-dimensional settings where\nthe presence of numerous irrelevant features can significantly hinder the performance of traditional\ngreedy algorithms. The increased exploration afforded by Top-k leads to deeper and more accurate\ntrees, resulting in improved predictive performance. Our theoretical analysis provides a rigorous foundation for the advantages of Top-k. We derive a lower\nbound on the generalization error of Top-k, demonstrating that under certain conditions, this bound\nis tighter than those achievable by traditional greedy algorithms [3]. The improvement is particularly pronounced in\nhigh-dimensional datasets, where the benefits of exploring multiple features become most evident. We leverage optimized data structures\nand algorithms to manage the top kfeature candidates, ensuring that the computational overhead\nremains manageable even for large datasets and high values of k. Our experiments demonstrate that\nthe computational cost scales gracefully with both the dataset size and the value of k, making Top-k a\npractical alternative to traditional decision tree algorithms in various applications. Beyond its improved accuracy and scalability, Top-k retains the inherent interpretability of decision\ntrees. The tree structure remains easily understandable, and the Top-k modification only adds a\nlayer of controlled exploration, not fundamentally altering the decision-making process. Furthermore, we explore the integration of Top-k into ensemble methods like random forests and\ngradient boosting machines, demonstrating its versatility and potential for further performance\nenhancements [4]. We also investigate the impact of different feature selection metrics on Top-k\u2019s\nperformance, providing insights into its adaptability to various datasets and problem domains. These algorithms, however, rely\non greedy approaches that select the single best feature at each node, potentially leading to suboptimal\nsplits and limited accuracy, especially in high-dimensional spaces. One line of research\nfocuses on improving the feature selection process itself, exploring more sophisticated metrics beyond\ninformation gain and Gini impurity ?. These ensemble techniques often mitigate the limitations of individual trees\nbut can introduce increased computational complexity. Our work builds upon this rich body of research by proposing a novel generalization of decision\ntree algorithms that directly addresses the limitations of greedy feature selection. Unlike traditional\nmethods that focus solely on the single best feature, Top-k explores the top kfeatures at each\nnode, offering a controlled trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. This approach is\ndistinct from other ensemble methods in that it modifies the base learner itself, rather than relying\non combining multiple independently trained trees. The parameter kprovides a flexible mechanism\nto adjust the exploration-exploitation balance, allowing practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their\nspecific needs and computational resources. This flexibility is a key advantage over existing methods\nthat often lack such a tunable parameter for controlling the complexity of the search space. Several studies have explored alternative splitting criteria for decision trees, aiming to improve\naccuracy and robustness. However, these\nstudies primarily focus on improving the single-feature selection process, without addressing the\nfundamental limitation of greedy approaches. Top-k, in contrast, directly tackles this limitation\nby considering multiple features at each split, offering a more robust and accurate approach. This\nfundamental difference distinguishes Top-k from previous work that primarily focuses on refining the\nfeature selection metric or the tree structure itself. However,\nthese methods often introduce increased computational complexity and can be less interpretable than\ntraditional decision trees. Top-k, on the other hand, maintains the inherent interpretability of decision\ntrees while offering a more efficient and scalable approach to multi-feature splitting. Furthermore, our work contributes to the broader field of high-dimensional data analysis. In high-\ndimensional settings, the presence of numerous irrelevant features can significantly hinder the\nperformance of traditional greedy algorithms. This is particularly\nrelevant in modern applications where datasets often contain thousands or even millions of features. The combination of\ntheoretical analysis and empirical validation strengthens the overall contribution of our work. construct trees by recursively partitioning the data based on a greedy selection of the single best\nfeature at each node. This greedy approach, while computationally efficient, suffers from limitations\nin accuracy and scalability, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional datasets or datasets\nwith noisy features. Furthermore, the computational cost of these algorithms can become prohibitive for large datasets,\nhindering their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The inherent limitations of greedy feature\nselection have motivated extensive research into alternative strategies for building more accurate and\nefficient decision trees. One area of active research focuses on improving the feature selection process itself. Researchers\nhave explored more sophisticated metrics beyond the commonly used information gain and Gini\nimpurity ?, aiming to identify more informative features for splitting. and gradient boosting machines ?, which combine multiple decision trees to improve predictive\nperformance. These ensemble techniques often mitigate the limitations of individual trees but can\nintroduce increased computational complexity and reduce interpretability. The challenge lies in\nfinding a balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. The single-\nbest-feature selection strategy can lead to premature commitment to suboptimal splits, hindering the\nability of the algorithm to discover more complex relationships within the data. This is particularly\nevident in high-dimensional datasets where the presence of many irrelevant features can significantly\nimpact the performance of greedy algorithms. The noise and irrelevant information can easily mislead\nthe algorithm, leading to inaccurate and unreliable predictions. This inherent limitation motivates\nthe need for more robust and less greedy approaches to decision tree construction. Our proposed Top-k algorithm directly addresses the limitations of greedy feature selection by\nconsidering multiple top features at each node. Instead of selecting only the single best feature, Top-k\nexplores the top kfeatures as potential split candidates. This allows for a more thorough exploration\nof the feature space, mitigating the risk of early commitment to suboptimal splits. Larger values of klead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy but\nincreasing computational complexity, while smaller values prioritize efficiency at the cost of some\naccuracy. This flexibility allows practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and\ncomputational resources. This approach reduces the probability of selecting an\nirrelevant or noisy feature early in the tree construction process, leading to deeper and more accurate\ntrees. The increased exploration afforded by Top-k is particularly beneficial in high-dimensional\nsettings where the presence of numerous irrelevant features can significantly hinder the performance\n3of traditional greedy algorithms. By considering multiple features, Top-k reduces the impact of\nnoise and irrelevant information, resulting in improved robustness and predictive performance. The improvement\nis particularly pronounced in high-dimensional datasets, where the benefits of exploring multiple\nfeatures become most evident. The combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation\nprovides a comprehensive understanding of Top-k\u2019s performance and its advantages over existing\nmethods. Furthermore, the inherent interpretability of decision trees is preserved in Top-k, making it\na valuable tool for applications where both high accuracy and explainability are crucial. 4 Methodology\nThe Top-k algorithm builds upon the fundamental principles of traditional decision tree algorithms\nbut introduces a key modification to the feature selection process. Instead of greedily selecting the\nsingle best feature at each node, Top-k considers the top kfeatures as potential split candidates. This\napproach significantly alters the search space explored during tree construction, leading to a more\nrobust and less prone-to-error process. The algorithm proceeds recursively, starting with the root\nnode and the entire dataset. At each node, the top kfeatures are identified based on a chosen splitting\ncriterion (e.g., information gain, Gini impurity). For each of these top kfeatures, the optimal split\npoint is determined, and the resulting information gain or impurity reduction is calculated. The\nfeature and split point yielding the maximum improvement are then selected to partition the data into\nchild nodes. This process is repeated recursively for each child node until a stopping criterion is met\n(e.g., maximum depth, minimum number of samples per leaf). We employ efficient sorting\nalgorithms to identify the top kfeatures based on the chosen splitting criterion. The computational\ncomplexity of this step is primarily determined by the sorting algorithm used and the number of\nfeatures in the dataset. To maintain efficiency, we leverage optimized data structures and algorithms,\nensuring that the computational overhead remains manageable even for large datasets and high values\nofk. The choice of\nsorting algorithm can be further optimized based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and\nthe available computational resources. Furthermore, we explored the use of approximate sorting\nalgorithms to further reduce the computational cost, particularly for very large datasets. We\ninvestigated the use of several common splitting criteria, including information gain, Gini impurity,\nand variance reduction. Each criterion offers a different trade-off between accuracy and computational\ncost. We also explored the possibility of using adaptive splitting criteria, which\ndynamically adjust the criterion based on the characteristics of the data at each node. The parameter kplays a crucial role in controlling the trade-off between accuracy and computational\ncost. Larger values of klead to a more exhaustive search of the feature space, potentially improv-\ning accuracy but increasing computational complexity. Conversely, smaller values of kprioritize\nefficiency, sacrificing some accuracy for speed. The optimal value of kdepends on the specific\ndataset and the available computational resources. This observation provides valuable guidance for practitioners in choosing an\n4appropriate value of kfor their specific applications. Furthermore, we explored adaptive strategies\nfor choosing the value of kduring training, dynamically adjusting it based on the characteristics of\nthe data at each node. We developed a Python implementation\nof the algorithm, leveraging efficient data structures and algorithms from the Scikit-learn library. The code is well-documented and readily available for reproducibility. The implementation includes\noptions for choosing different splitting criteria, setting the value of k, and specifying various stopping\ncriteria. The modular design of the code allows for easy extension and customization. The computa-\ntional cost of the algorithm scales gracefully with both the dataset size and the value of k, making it\na practical alternative to traditional decision tree algorithms in various applications. The computational cost of Top-k, while higher than\ntraditional greedy algorithms, remained manageable, especially when considering the significant\nimprovement in accuracy. The parameter kprovided a flexible mechanism to control this trade-off,\nallowing practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and computational resources. We compared Top-k against three widely used decision tree algorithms:\nID3?, C4.5 ?, and CART ?. The datasets were pre-processed to handle missing values\nand outliers, ensuring a fair comparison across all algorithms. We employed standard data splitting\ntechniques, reserving a portion of each dataset for testing and using the remaining data for training. Performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score,\nproviding a comprehensive assessment of the algorithm\u2019s predictive capabilities. The choice of\nthese metrics was driven by the need to capture various aspects of the algorithm\u2019s performance,\nincluding its ability to correctly classify positive and negative instances. Furthermore, we analyzed\nthe computational cost of each algorithm, measuring the training time and memory usage to assess\ntheir scalability. To investigate this trade-off, we conducted experiments with varying values of k, ranging\nfrom 1 (equivalent to traditional greedy algorithms) to a significantly larger value determined by the\ndimensionality of the dataset. We observed that increasing kgenerally led to improved accuracy, particularly in high-\ndimensional datasets where the greedy selection of a single feature can be highly susceptible to noise\nand irrelevant information. However, this improvement came at the cost of increased computational\ntime, highlighting the inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Information gain generally yielded\nhigher accuracy but at a higher computational cost, while Gini impurity provided a good balance\nbetween accuracy and efficiency. Further research could explore more sophisticated feature selection\nmetrics or adaptive strategies that dynamically adjust the metric based on the data at each node. The publicly available datasets\nwere chosen to represent a range of characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, and\nclass distribution. The custom datasets were designed to test the algorithm\u2019s performance under\ncontrolled conditions, allowing us to isolate the effects of specific factors such as noise and irrelevant\nfeatures. Top-k consistently achieves higher accuracy while maintaining\na reasonable computational cost. The increase in computational cost is justified by the significant\nimprovement in accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional datasets. The choice of ksignificantly\nimpacts the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, allowing practitioners to tailor the\nalgorithm to their specific needs. Future work will focus on exploring adaptive\nstrategies for choosing kand investigating the algorithm\u2019s performance on even larger and more\ncomplex datasets. We\nassessed performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and computational cost (training\ntime and memory usage). The datasets were pre-processed to handle missing values and outliers,\nensuring a fair comparison. A stratified k-fold cross-validation approach was employed to mitigate\nthe effects of data variability and obtain robust performance estimates. The specific datasets used\nincluded several publicly available datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository, chosen to\nrepresent diverse characteristics in terms of dimensionality, sample size, and class distribution. We\n6also included synthetic datasets generated to control specific factors like noise levels and feature\nrelevance, allowing for a more targeted analysis of the algorithm\u2019s behavior under various conditions. As expected, increasing k\ngenerally led to improved accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional datasets where the greedy\nselection of a single feature is more susceptible to noise and irrelevant information. However, this\nimprovement came at the cost of increased computational time, reflecting the increased search space\nexplored by the algorithm. This observation highlights the\nflexibility of Top-k in adapting to different data characteristics and computational constraints. Information gain generally yielded higher accuracy but at a higher computational cost, while Gini\nimpurity provided a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. Future work could explore\nmore sophisticated feature selection metrics or adaptive strategies that dynamically adjust the metric\nbased on the data at each node. The increase in computational cost is relatively modest, especially considering the significant\naccuracy gains. A more comprehensive analysis, including precision, recall, F1-score, and statistical\nsignificance tests, is provided in the supplementary material. This is consistent with our hypothesis\nthat considering multiple top features mitigates the risk of early commitment to suboptimal splits\ncaused by the greedy nature of traditional algorithms. The flexibility offered by the parameter k\nallows practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs, balancing computational cost and\npredictive performance. The tree\nstructure remains easily understandable, and the Top-k modification only adds a layer of controlled\nexploration during the feature selection process, not fundamentally altering the decision-making\nprocess. This makes Top-k particularly suitable for applications where both high accuracy and\nexplainability are crucial. 7Future work will focus on exploring adaptive strategies for choosing k, investigating the algorithm\u2019s\nperformance on even larger and more complex datasets, and extending Top-k to other tree-based\nensemble methods. Our approach departs from the\ntraditional greedy methods (ID3, C4.5, CART) ? by considering the top kfeatures as potential\nsplit candidates at each node, rather than just the single best feature. This strategic modification\nallows for a more thorough exploration of the feature space, mitigating the risk of early commitment\nto suboptimal splits that often plague greedy algorithms, especially in high-dimensional settings. The\nparameter kprovides a flexible mechanism to control this exploration-exploitation trade-off, enabling\npractitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and computational resources. Larger values\nofklead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy but increasing computational\ncomplexity, while smaller values prioritize efficiency. Our theoretical analysis provided a rigorous foundation for the advantages of Top-k. We derived\na lower bound on the generalization error, demonstrating that under certain conditions, this bound\nis tighter than those achievable by traditional greedy algorithms ?. The improvement in accuracy is not achieved at the expense of excessive\ncomputational cost; our experiments demonstrated that the computational overhead scales gracefully\nwith both dataset size and the value of k, making Top-k a practical alternative for various applications. The choice of the splitting criterion also plays a significant role in Top-k\u2019s performance. The inherent interpretability of decision trees is preserved in Top-k,\nmaking it suitable for applications requiring both high accuracy and explainability. The simplicity\nof the Top-k algorithm, coupled with its improved performance, makes it a valuable tool for a wide\nrange of machine learning tasks. We observed a clear trade-off between accuracy and computational cost as kincreases. While larger\nvalues of kgenerally lead to higher accuracy, especially in high-dimensional datasets, they also\nincrease computational time. This highlights the importance of carefully selecting the value of k\nbased on the specific application and available computational resources. Future research could focus\non developing adaptive strategies for automatically determining the optimal value of kduring training,\nfurther enhancing the algorithm\u2019s efficiency and performance. Beyond its improved accuracy and scalability, Top-k retains the inherent interpretability of decision\ntrees. The tree structure remains easily understandable, and the Top-k modification only adds a layer\nof controlled exploration, not fundamentally altering the decision-making process. This makes Top-k\nparticularly suitable for applications where both high accuracy and explainability are crucial. The flexibility provided\nby the parameter kallows practitioners to fine-tune the algorithm to their specific needs, balancing\ncomputational cost and predictive performance. Future research directions include exploring adaptive\nstrategies for selecting k, investigating its performance on even larger and more complex datasets,\nand extending Top-k to other tree-based ensemble methods.",

        "Abstract": "Rapid Image Annotation Through Zero-Shot Learning\nAbstract\nRecent experiments on word analogies demonstrate that contemporary word vectors\neffectively encapsulate subtle linguistic patterns through linear vector displace-\nments.",
        "Methodology": "This research in-\nvestigates a particular image-word relevance relationship. Specifically, we utilize linear mappings and intricate\ndeep neural networks to deduce the primary axis from an input image. It operates swiftly on test\nimages, with a processing time that remains constant regardless of the training set\u2019s\nsize. Nevertheless, it is yet to be determined whether the visual\npatterns across words, implicitly employed in the aforementioned computer vision tasks, can similarly\nbe represented by these basic vector offsets. Given this context, it is worth\ninvestigating whether word vectors maintain the property where simple linear vector offsets can\ndepict visual or image-based associative relationships between words. This can be expressed as:\n(w,p \u02d82014 n) > 0 equivalently, (w,p) > (w,n)\nThis implies that the vector w ranks all relevant words Y ahead of irrelevant ones Y . The visual association patterns among words manifest as the linear rank-abilities of their correspond-\ning word vectors. Building on this discovery, we propose a solution to the image tagging challenge by identifying the\nprimary axis along which relevant tags are ranked higher than irrelevant ones within the word vector\nspace. We employ both linear mappings and deep neural networks to infer this primary axis from\neach input image. It not only delivers outstanding results in traditional tagging tasks but also\nexcels at assigning new tags from a broad vocabulary that were not encountered during training. Our\nmethod does not rely on prior knowledge of these new tags, as long as they exist within the same\nvector space as the tags used during training. In stark contrast to our approach, prior methods for image tagging are limited to assigning only those\ntags to test images that were seen during training, with a notable exception. These methods are\nconstrained by the fixed and often limited number of tags present in the training data, which poses\npractical challenges. However, when compared to our proposed method, it depends on\ntwo extra assumptions. Firstly, it assumes that unseen tags are known beforehand to enable model\nadjustment toward these tags. Secondly, it assumes that test images are known in advance for model\nregularization. Moreover, this method is restricted to a very limited number, U, of unseen tags, as it\nneeds to account for all 2Upossibletagcombinations. To recap, our primary contribution lies in analyzing visual association patterns in words as they relate\nto images and how these patterns are reflected in word vector offsets. Our Fast0Tag method surpasses competitive baselines across all three scenarios. Generative approaches, which incorporate topic models and\nmixture models, inherently rank candidate tags based on their conditional probabilities relative to the\ntest image. Conversely, non-parametric, nearest-neighbor-based techniques frequently rank tags for\na test image by aggregating votes from a selection of training images. Although nearest-neighbor\nmethods generally exhibit superior performance compared to those reliant on generative models,\nthey are plagued by substantial computational demands during both training and testing phases. Our Fast0Tag method mirrors the reduced\ncomplexity of FastTag. Embedding techniques, on the other hand, determine tag ranking scores via\na cross-modal mapping between images and tags. Notably, aside from certain exceptions, the majority of these methods do not\ntrain their models with an explicit ranking objective, despite ultimately ranking candidate tags for\ntest images. We incorporate a ranking loss in our approach, similar to these\nexceptions. Unlike our Fast0Tag, which is capable of ranking both known and an unlimited number\nof previously unseen tags for test images, the methods mentioned earlier are restricted\nto assigning tags to images from a predetermined vocabulary encountered during train-\ning. An exception to this is the work by Fu et al., where they address a predefined\nnumber, U, of unseen tags by developing a multi-label model that considers all possible\n2Ucombinationsofthesetags.However, thisapproachisconstrainedbythesmallnumberUofunseentagsitcanhandle. Diverging from the conventional one-hot vector representation of words, word\nembedding maps each word to a continuous-valued vector, primarily learning from the statistical\npatterns of word co-occurrences. In this study, we further reveal that basic linear offsets can also represent the\nbroader visual association patterns among words. Zero-Shot Learning. In contrast to weakly-supervised\nlearning, which acquires new concepts by extracting information from noisy samples, zero-shot\nclassification aims to classify objects from unseen classes by learning classifiers from seen classes. Our Fast0Tag, together with Fu et al., expands the domain of zero-shot learning to include zero-\nshot multi-label classification. approach this by converting the problem into zero-shot\nclassification, where each combination of multiple labels is treated as a separate class. We, on the\nother hand, model the labels directly, allowing us to assign or rank a large number of unseen tags for\nan image. 3 The Linear Rank-Ability of Word Vectors\nOur Fast0Tag method is enhanced by the discovery that the visual relationship between words,\nspecifically how a lexicon is divided based on relevance to an image, manifests in the word vector\nspace as a main direction. Along this direction, words or tags that are relevant to the image are ranked\nhigher than those that are not. The training data is structured as (xm, Ym); m = 1, 2, ...,\nM, where xm represents the feature vector of image m in RD, and Ym is a subset of S, containing\nthe seen tags relevant to that image. For simplicity, we also use Ym to represent the collection of\ncorresponding word or tag vectors. Zero-shot tagging, as\ndefined by Fu et al., aims to annotate test images using a predetermined set of unseen tags, U. Beyond\nthese two scenarios, this paper introduces seen/unseen image tagging, which identifies both relevant\nseen tags from S and relevant unseen tags from U for test images. Furthermore, the set of unseen\ntags, U, can be open and continuously expanding. We define Ym as the complement of Ym in S, representing irrelevant seen tags. Recognizing that various detailed syntactic and semantic patterns among words\n3can be depicted through linear word vector offsets, we proceed to investigate the characteristics these\nvector offsets might exhibit for this novel visual association rule. This\nsuggests that along this principal direction, relevant tags Ym are ranked higher than irrelevant ones\nYm. Moreover, all offsets that point to the same relevant tag in Ym are\ngrouped within the same cluster. The question remains whether these two observations can be generalized. Specifically, do they remain\nvalid in the high-dimensional word vector space for a broader range of visual association rules defined\nby other images? 3.3 Testing the Linear Rank-Ability Hypothesis\nThe experiments in this section are performed using the validation set of the NUS-WIDE dataset,\nwhich includes 26,844 images, 925 seen tags (S), and 81 unseen tags (U). The number of relevant\nseen/unseen tags associated with an image varies from 1 to 20/117, with an average of 1.7/4.9. Our goal is to explore whether a primary direction exists for any visual association rule (Ym, Ym)\ncreated by image m, along which relevant tags Ym rank higher than irrelevant tags Ym. To achieve this, we train a linear ranking SVM for each visual association rule using all corresponding\npairs (p, n). We then rank word vectors using the SVM and assess the number of violated constraints. Specifically, we use MiAP, with higher values being preferable, to compare the SVM\u2019s ranking list\nagainst the ranking constraints. This process is repeated for all validation images, resulting in 21,863\nunique visual association rules. Ranking SVM Implementation. The\nhorizontal axis represents various regularizations used for training the ranking SVMs, with higher\nvalues indicating stronger regularization. 4Therefore, we anticipate that the principal direction for seen tags should also apply to unseen tags\nunder the same rule, if the questions at the end of Section 3.2 are answered affirmatively. This is partially\nvalidated by applying the previously trained ranking SVMs to unseen tag vectors, as the \"true\"\nprincipal directions are unknown. We use the 81 unseen tags U as \"test data\" for the trained ranking\nSVMs, each resulting from an image-induced visual association. 4 Approximating the Linear Ranking Functions\nThis section introduces our Fast0Tag approach for image tagging. Initially, we explain how to address\nimage tagging by approximating the principal directions, based on their existence and generalization,\nas confirmed in the previous section. Subsequently, we describe the detailed approximation methods\nused. The core idea is to approximate this principal direction by learning\na mapping function, f( \u02d800b7), that connects the visual space to the word vector space, such that:\nf(xm) wm\nHere, xm is the visual feature representation of image m. Consequently, given a test image x, we\ncan promptly suggest a list of tags by ranking the word vectors of the tags along the direction f(x),\nspecifically by the ranking scores:\nt S U, (f(x), t)\nThis applies whether the tags are from the seen set S or the unseen set U. We investigate both linear and nonlinear neural networks to implement the approximation function\nf(x) w.\n4.2 Approximation by Linear Regression\nIn this approach, we assume a linear function from the input image representation x to the output\nprincipal direction w, defined as:\nf(x) := Ax\nHere, A can be determined in a closed form through linear regression. Thus, from the training data,\nwe have:\nwm=Axm+m, form = 1,2, ..., M\nwhere w mistheprincipaldirectionforalloffsetvectorsoftheseentags, correspondingtothevisualassociationrule (Ym, Ym)forimagem, and mrepresentstheerrors.Minimizingthemeansquarederrorsprovidesuswithaclosed \u2212\nformsolutionforA. We further extend this to a\nnonlinear transformation using a neural network. We anticipate that the nonlinear mapping function f(x; ) will provide greater modeling flexibility\ncompared to the linear approach. Training the neural network by regressing to the M directions obtained from ranking SVMs is not\nideal, as confirmed by both intuition and experiments. The number of training instances, M, is small\nrelative to the network\u2019s parameter count, increasing the risk of overfitting. Moreover, the directions\nfrom ranking SVMs are not the true principal directions, making it unnecessary to rely on them. We aim for the neural network\u2019s output f(xm; )\nto represent the principal direction, where all relevant tag vectors p Ym rank higher than irrelevant\nones n Ym for an image m. Let\u2019s define:\nv(p, n; ) = (f(xm; ), n) - (f(xm; ), p)\nas the degree of violation of these ranking constraints. We then minimize the following loss function to train the neural network:\n* = argmin w m\u2217l(xm, Ym; )l(xm, Ym; ) =log(1 +expv (p, n; ))forpY m, nYm\nwhere w m= 1/(|Ym|\u2217|Ym|)normalizestheper \u2212imageRankNetlossbythenumberofrankingconstraintsimposedbyimagemoverthetags.Thissetupallowsthefunctionf (x)todirectlyconsidertherankingconstraintsfromrelevantandirrelevanttags, anditcanbeoptimizedeffectivelyusingstandardmini \u2212\nbatchgradientdescent. We use Theano for optimization, with a mini-batch size\nof 1,000 images. Each image, on average, imposes 4,600 pairwise ranking con-\nstraints, which are all used in the optimization. We primarily utilize the NUS-WIDE dataset for our experiments. Following\nthe recommended protocol, we divide the dataset into a training set of 134,281 images and a test\nset of 89,603 images. These tags are annotated by students and are less noisy than those directly collected from the\nWeb, serving as the ground truth for evaluating image tagging methods. We extract and normalize image feature representations using\nVGG-19. We assess tagging results using two types of metrics: mean image average precision\n(MiAP), which considers the entire ranking list, and precision, recall, and F1-score for the top K tags\nin the list (K = 3 and K = 5). Baselines. For a\nfair comparison, we use the same VGG-19 features across all methods, with code for TagProp and\nFastTag provided by the authors and WARP implemented based on our neural network architecture. Additionally, we compare to WSABIE and CCA, which correlate images and relevant tags in a\nlow-dimensional space. Hyperparameters for all methods are selected using the validation set. TagProp significantly outperforms WARP and FastTag, but its training and testing complexities are\nhigh, at O(M2)andO(M)respectively, relative to the training set size M. In contrast, WARP and\nFastTag are more efficient, with O(M) training complexity and constant testing complexity due to\ntheir parametric nature. Both implementations maintain\nlow computational complexities similar to WARP and FastTag.

Our Fast0Tag naturally applies to this scenario by simply ranking\nthe unseen tags with equation (3). Furthermore, this paper also considers seen/unseen image tagging,\n7which finds both relevant seen tags from S and relevant unseen tags from U for the test images. The\nset of unseen tags U could be open and dynamically growing. In our experiments, we treat the 81 concepts with high-quality user annotations in NUS-WIDE as\nthe unseen set U for evaluation and comparison. We use the remaining 925 out of the 1000 frequent\nFlickr tags to form the seen set S - 75 tags are shared by the original 81 and 1,000 tags. Baselines. Our Fast0Tag models can be readily applied to the zero-shot and seen/unseen image\ntagging scenarios. We first propose a simple method that extends an arbitrary traditional image tagging\nmethod to also work with previously unseen tags. First, we use any existing method to rank the seen tags for a test image. Second, we train a\nranking SVM in the word vector space using the ranking list of the seen tags. Third, we rank unseen\n(and seen) tags using the learned SVM for zero-shot (and seen/unseen) tagging. The label embedding method achieves impressive results on zero-shot classification for\nfine-grained object recognition. We also modify the objective loss function of LabelEM when we train\nthe model, by carefully removing the terms that involve duplicated images. Again by considering each tag as a class, we include a recent\nzero-shot classification method, ConSE in the following experiments. The\nRandom row corresponds to the case when we return a random list of tags in U for zero-shot tagging\n(and in U S for seen/unseen tagging) to each test image. We compare this row with the row of\nSeen2Unseen, in which we extend TagProp to handle the unseen tags. Given a test image, we assume the annotation of the seen tags,\nS, are known and then learn a ranking SVM with the default regularization = 1. The learned SVM\nis then used to rank the unseen tags for this image. This is not surprising, but rather it reinforces our previous statement that the learned ranking\nSVMs are not the \"true\" principal directions. The Fast0Tag implemented by the neural network is an\neffective alternative for seeking the principal directions. What happens when we have a large number of unseen tags showing\nup at the test stage? Excluding the 925 seen tags that are used to train models, there are 4,093 remaining unseen\ntags. We use\nthe same tag annotation and image training-test split as described in prior work for our experiments. The dataset is split into 17,341 training\nimages and 2,286 testing images. We further separate 15\n6.1 Configuration\nSimilar to the experiments in the previous section, we evaluate our methods in three distinct tasks:\nconventional tagging, zero-shot tagging, and seen/unseen tagging. For the zero-shot and seen/unseen tagging tasks, we exclude 20The visual\nfeatures, evaluation metrics, word vectors, and baseline methods remain the same as described in the\nmain text. A notable observation, which is less apparent on NUS-WIDE\nprobably due to its noisier seen tags, is the significant performance gap between LabelEM+ and\nLabelEM. This indicates that traditional zero-shot classification methods may not be directly suitable\nfor either zero-shot or seen/unseen image tagging tasks. 7 More Qualitative Results\nIn this section, we provide additional qualitative results from different tagging methods on both the\nNUS-WIDE and IAPRTC-12 datasets. Due to the incompleteness and noise in tag ground truth, many accurate tag predictions\nare often incorrectly assessed as mistakes because they don\u2019t match the ground truth. We also\ninvestigated how this rule is captured by vector offsets within the word vector space. Based on this discovery, we developed a Fast0Tag model to address\nimage tagging by estimating the primary directions for input images. Our method is as efficient as\nFastTag and is capable of annotating images with a large number of previously unseen tags.",
        "Results and Findings": "However, the extent to which these straightforward vector displacements\ncan represent visual patterns across words remains uncertain. The findings indicate\nthat, for a given image, word vectors of pertinent tags are positioned higher than\nthose of unrelated tags along a primary axis within the word vector space. Furthermore, it showcases exceptional performance not only in conventional\ntagging tasks using the NUS-WIDE dataset but also in comparison to competitive\nbaselines when assigning tags to images that haven\u2019t been seen during training. The rationale behind using word vectors in NLP is rooted in the\nobservation that detailed linguistic patterns among words are represented by linear offsets of word\nvectors. Instead, it concerns the connection between\ntwo sets of words as prompted by a visual image. This type of word relationship is semantic and\ndescriptive, emphasizing visual association, albeit at a broader level. A primary contribution of this research is an empirical investigation of these questions. Each image\nestablishes a visual association rule over words, represented as a pair (Y , Y). Our findings uncover a significant correlation: the offsets between the vectors of relevant tags\n(Y) and those of irrelevant tags (Y) predominantly align in a consistent direction, which we term the\n\"principal direction\". This observation corroborates findings from word analogy studies, suggesting that\nmultiple relationships for a single word are embedded within a high-dimensional space. Furthermore,\nthese relationships can be articulated using basic linear vector arithmetic. The model processes test images rapidly, maintaining a constant processing time irrespective of the\ntraining dataset\u2019s size. The work of Fu et al. We posit and confirm through\nexperiments that a main direction exists in the word vector space for each visual association rule\n(Y , Y), where vectors of relevant words are ranked higher than others. 2The recently introduced FastTag algorithm offers a significant speed advantage while maintaining\nperformance levels on par with nearest-neighbor methods. Word Embedding. Fu et al. This section elaborates on this discovery. Traditional image tagging seeks to assign seen tags from S to test images. Cluster Structure: Within each visual association rule over words, there are discernible cluster\nstructures in the vector offsets. In Figure 2, we distinguish offsets pointing to different relevant tags\nby using different colors. To address this, we designed an experiment to confirm the existence of principal\ndirections in word vector spaces, or equivalently, the linear rank-ability of word vectors. Further\ndetails can be found in Section 5. This can be\nconfirmed if we find a vector w in the word vector space that fulfills the ranking conditions (w, p) >\n(w, n) for all p in Ym and n in Ym. The average MiAP outcomes across all distinct regulations are presented in Figure 3(left). We evaluate 300D GloVe vectors and word2vec vectors of dimensions 100, 300, 500, and 1000. In the 300D GloVe space and word2vec spaces of 300, 500,\nand 1000 dimensions, more than two ranking SVMs, with low values, produce nearly ideal ranking\nresults (MiAP 1). This demonstrates that seen tags S are linearly rankable under almost every visual\nassociation rule, satisfying all ranking constraints set by relevant Ym and irrelevant Ym tags for\nimage m.\nHowever, caution is advised before extending conclusions beyond the experimental vocabulary S\nof seen tags. We investigate whether the same principal direction applies to both\nseen and unseen tags under each visual association rule induced by an image. NUS-WIDE provides annotations\nfor these 81 tags. The results, shown in Figure 3(right), significantly outperform the basic baseline of\nrandom tag ranking, indicating that the directions produced by SVMs are generalizable to the new\nvocabulary U of words. We have\nempirically confirmed that the visual association rule (Ym, Ym) in words due to an image m can be\nrepresented by the linear rank-ability of corresponding word vectors along a principal direction. 4.1 Image Tagging by Ranking\nBased on the findings from Section 3, which indicate the existence of a principal direction, wm, in the\nword vector space for each visual association rule (Ym, Ym) generated by an image m, we propose a\ndirect solution for image tagging. Instead, we integrate the two stages from Section 4.2.

Besides the RankNet loss, we tested other per-image loss options, including hinge loss, Crammer-\nSinger loss, and pairwise max-out ranking. Crammer-Singer, pairwise max-out, and RankNet yielded comparable\nresults, with RankNet slightly outperforming the others by about 2% in MiAP, possibly due to easier\noptimization control. 5 Experiments on NUS-WIDE\nThis section details our experimental results, comparing our method against several strong baselines\nfor traditional image tagging on the large-scale NUS-WIDE dataset. Additionally, we evaluate our\nmethod on zero-shot and seen/unseen image tagging scenarios, extending some existing zero-shot\nclassification algorithms and exploring variations of our approach for comparison. We were able\nto retrieve 223,821 images, as some were either corrupted or removed from Flickr. NUS-WIDE provides three sets of tags for its images. Both GloVe and Word2vec word vectors are used in our empirical analysis in Section 3,\nwith 300D GloVe vectors used for the remaining experiments. Evaluation. (2015)\nand Section 4.2 of Gong et al. 5.2 Conventional Image Tagging\nIn this section, we present experimental results for traditional image tagging, using the 81 \"ground\ntruth\" annotated concepts in NUS-WIDE to benchmark various methods. We include TagProp as a primary competitive baseline, representing nearest-neighbor-\nbased methods that generally outperform parametric methods built from generative models and have\nshown state-of-the-art results in experimental studies. Table 4 presents the comparison results among TagProp, WARP, FastTag, WSABIE, CCA,\nand our Fast0Tag models, implemented with both linear mapping and a nonlinear neural network. Our Fast0Tag with linear mapping yields results comparable to TagProp,\nwhile Fast0Tag with the neural network surpasses the other methods.

Fu et al. LabelEM. Table 5 summarizes the results of the baselines and Fast0Tag when they are applied to\nthe zero-shot and seen/unseen image tagging tasks. Additionally, in the table, we add two special rows whose results are mainly for reference. We can see that the results of\nSeen2Unseen are significantly better than randomly ranking the tags. We obtain its\nresults through the following steps. One may wonder that the results of this row\nshould thus be the upper bound of our Fast0Tag implemented based on linear regression because the\nranking SVM models are the targets of the linear regression. These results are encouraging, indicating that it is unnecessary to use\nall the candidate tags for training in order to have high-quality tagging performance. NUS-WIDE provides noisy annotations for the images with over 5,000 Flickr\ntags. We use the Fast0Tag models to rank all the unseen tags for the test images, and the results\nare shown in Table 3. Noting that the noisy annotations weaken the credibility of the evaluation\nprocess, the results are reasonably low but significantly higher than the random lists. Qualitative\nresults. Interestingly, Fast0Tag performs\nequally well for traditional and zero-shot tagging and makes even the same mistakes. 6 Experiments on IAPRTC-12\nWe present another set of experiments conducted on the widely used IAPRTC-12 dataset. There are 291 unique tags and 19,627 images in IAPRTC-12. 6.2 Results\nTables 4 and 5 display the results for all three image tagging scenarios (conventional, zero-shot, and\nseen/unseen tagging). The proposed Fast0Tag continues to outperform the other competitive baselines\non this new IAPRTC-12 dataset. These are presented to supplement the findings discussed in\nthe main text. Our empirical\nfindings demonstrate that for any given image, there exists a main direction in the word vector\nspace along which vectors of relevant tags are ranked higher than those of irrelevant tags. 9",
        "Conclusion": "Lastly, we explore three distinct image tagging scenarios:\ntraditional tagging, which assigns seen tags to images; zero-shot tagging, which annotates images\nwith numerous unseen tags; and seen/unseen tagging, which uses both seen and unseen tags.

        "Abstract": "Distant Supervision from Disparate Sources for\nLow-Resource Part-of-Speech Tagging\nAbstract\nWe introduce DSDS: a cross-lingual neural part-of-speech tagger that learns from\ndisparate sources of distant supervision, and realistically scales to hundreds of low-\nresource languages. What is more interesting is that our model\nbenefits from the lexicon beyond its content: OOV accuracy for words not present in the lexicon\noverall improves, besides the expected improvement on known OOV , see Figure 3 (b).",
        "Methodology": "The model exploits annotation projection, instance selection,\ntag dictionaries, morphological lexicons, and distributed representations, all in a\nuniform framework. The approach is simple, yet surprisingly effective, resulting in\na new state of the art without access to any gold annotated data. We propose a method to strike a balance between model simplicity and the capacity to easily integrate\nheterogeneous learning signals. We use it to combine: i) multi-source annotation projection, ii) instance\nselection, iii) noisy tag dictionaries, and iv) distributed word and sub-word representations. We\nexamine how far we can get by exploiting only the wide-coverage resources that are currently readily\navailable for more than 300 languages, which is the breadth of the parallel corpus we employ. Ever since the seminal work of projecting sequential labels from source to\ntarget languages has been one of the most prevalent approaches to crosslingual learning. Its only\nrequirement is that parallel texts are available between the languages, and that the source side is\nannotated for POS. We apply the approach by where labels are projected from multiple sources and then decoded through\nweighted majority voting with word alignment probabilities and source POS tagger confidences. Weexploit their widecoverage Watchtower corpus (WTC), in contrast to the typically used Europarl data. Europarl covers 21 languages of the EU with 400k-2M sentence pairs, while WTC spans 300+ widely\ndiverse languages with only 10-100k pairs, in effect sacrificing depth for breadth, and introducing a\nmore radical domain shift. While selected 20k projected sentences at random to train taggers, we propose a novel alternative:\nselection by coverage. We rank the target sentences by percentage of words covered by word\nalignment from 21 sources and select the top k covered instances for training. In specific, we employ\nthe mean coverage ranking of target sentences, whereby each target sentence is coupled with the\narithmetic mean of the 21 individual word alignment coverages for each of the 21 source-language\nsentences. There are several ways to\nexploit such information: i) as type constraints during encoding, ii) to guide unsupervised learning,\nor iii) as addiional signal at training. We represent as concatenation of all embedded m properies of length [, and a zero vector\notherwise. We compare to the following weaklysupervised POS taggers: AGIC: Multi-source\nannotation projection with Bible parallel data DAS: The label propagation approach by over Europarl\ndata. We employ UD test sets on additional languages as well as the test sets\nof to facilitate comparisons. Their test sets are a mixture of CoNLL and HamleDT test data, and are\nmore distant from the training and development data. Model and parameters. The code is available at: https:// github.com/bplank/bilstm-aux. The parameter l=40\nwas set on dev data across all languages. For the learning curve, we average over 5\nrandom samples with 3 runs each. Training on 5k\ninstances results in a sweet spot; more data (10k) starts to decrease performance, at a cost of runtime. It helps the most on morphological rich languages such as Uralic. 5 Discussion\nAnalysis. All data sources employed in our experiment are very high-coverage. However, for\ntrue low-resource languages, we cannot safely assume the availability of all disparate information\nsources. We observe that adding lexicon information always helps, even in cases where only\n1k entries are available, and embedding it is usually the most beneficial way. We assume not having access to any gold annotated data. It is thus interesting\nto ask how much gold data is needed to reach our performance. This is a tricky question, as training\nwithin the same corpus naturally favors the same corpus data. We test both in-corpus (UD)\nand out-of-corpus data (our test sets) and notice an important gap: while in-corpus only 50 sentences\nare sufficient, outside the corpus one would need over 200 sentences. We additionally attempted to reach the\nscores of LI by running their tagger over the Table 1 data setup. This is in slight contrast to 50 iterations\nthat recommend, although selecting 50 does not dramatically hurt the scores; ii) Our replication falls\n\u02d8223c5 points short of their 84.9 accuracy. Compared to DAS, our tagger clearly benefits from pre-trained word embeddings, while theirs relies\non label propagation through Europarl, a much cleaner corpus that lacks the coverage of the noisier\nWTC. Similar applies to as they use 1-5M near-perfect parallel sentences. Our paper contributes to this literature by leveraging a range of prior directions in a unified, neural\ntest bed. Most prior work on neural sequence prediction follows the commonly perceived wisdom that hand-\ncrafted features are unnecessary for deep learning methods. They rely on end-to-end training without\nresorting to additional linguistic resources. Only few prior\nstudies investigate such sources, e.g., for MT and for POS tagging use lexicons, but only as n-hot\nfeatures and without examining the cross-lingual aspect. Comparison to TnT trained on PROJ. Only 5k instances of projected data paired with\noff-the-shelf embeddings and lexical information integrated into a neural tagger are sufficient to reach\na new state of the art, and both data selection and embeddings are essential components to boost\nneural tagging performance.",
        "Results and Findings": "Our results suggest that combining supervision sources is the way to go about creating\nviable low-resource taggers. We demonstrate: i) substantial gains in carefully selecting high-quality\ninstances in annotation projection, ii) the usefulness of lexicon features for neural tagging, and iii)\nthe importance of word embeddings initialization for faster convergence. However, as our results show little projected data turns out to be the most\nbeneficial, reinforcing breadth for depth. We show that this simple approach to instance selection offers substantial improvements:\nacross all languages, we learn better taggers with significantly fewer training instances. Tuning on the dev set, we found the second embedding approach to perform best, and\nsimple concatenaion outperformed mean vector representations. We evaluate two dictionary sources, motivated by ease of accessibility to many languages: WIK-\nTIONARY , a word type dictionary that maps tokens to one of the 12 Universal POS tags; and\nUNIMORPH, a morphological dictionary that provides inflectional paradigms across 350 languages.

        "Abstract": "A Toolkit for Scrutinizing Neural Network Activations\nAbstract\nThis document introduces diagNNose, an open-source toolkit designed for the\nexamination of activations within deep neural networks. The library offers abstrac-\ntions that enable the investigation of recurrent models in a manner similar to\nTransformer models, using a modular design. diagNNose is released under the MIT License.",
        "Methodology": "diagNNose offers a diverse\ncollection of interpretability methods, enabling a deeper understanding of the\noperational dynamics of neural networks. The diagNNose library equips researchers with tools to gain\nenhanced understanding of the internal representations formed by these networks,\nproviding a comprehensive suite of established analysis methods. We enhance the open-source ecosystem\nby integrating several interpretability techniques. Recent years have witnessed significant interest in enhancing our understanding of\nthe mechanisms by which deep neural networks function. The high-dimensional\narchitecture of these models makes deciphering their internal dynamics a complex\nendeavor. diagNNose seeks to consolidate a range of\nthese interpretability techniques into a unified library. It includes a module for extracting\nmodel activations. The analysis methods currently implemented in the library\ninclude targeted syntactic evaluation tasks, probing with diagnostic classifiers, and\nfeature attributions. Approaches in this field\nare frequently interdisciplinary. diagNNose facilitates several influential analysis\nmethods. These\nmodels are trained to predict the probability of upcoming or masked tokens. Toachieve success in this task, models must grasp various linguistic aspects, including\nsyntax, semantics, and general domain knowledge. One notable area of research\ninvestigating a model\u2019s linguistic competence employs targeted syntactic evalu-\nations. This analysis method contrasts a model\u2019s outputs on minimally different\npairs of grammatical and ungrammatical constructions. 2.2 Diagnostic Classifiers\nAnother line of research evaluates a model\u2019s comprehension of linguistic properties\nby training diagnostic classifiers on its representations. The activations used for training these classifiers are not limited to the\nhidden states of a language model at its top layer. Several methods have been put forward to address this, such as using control tasks\nor assessing classifiers based on minimum description length. diagNNose currently\nsupports the training of diagnostic classifiers and control tasks. This can be addressed by calculating the contributions of input fea-\ntures to subsequent outputs. This is a complex task due to the high-dimensional,\nnon-linear nature of deep learning models. Feature attributions can be calculated in various manners. 3.1.1 Core Modules\nThe foundational modules underpinning the various pipelines that can be built\nusing diagNNose are detailed below. For recurrent models, we provide an interface that allows access to\nintermediate activations, including gate activations. A\nCorpus can be converted into an iterator for processing. This process is not restricted to the top layer; intermediate (gate) activations\ncan also be extracted. Activations can be dynamically saved to disk to facilitate the\nextraction from large corpora with limited computational resources. We also offer functionality for extracting only particular subsets\nof activations, based on sentence and token information. **probe:** We furnish convenient tools for training diagnostic classifiers on ex-\ntracted activations to probe for linguistic information that may be embedded within\nthem. Our extraction module also enables training diagnostic classifiers on in-\ntermediate activations, including gate activations. To address concerns that high\nprobing accuracy does not necessarily indicate that linguistic information is actively\nencoded, we have incorporated functionality for Control Tasks. **attribute:** We offer capabilities for model-agnostic feature attributions, en-\nabling the decomposition of a model\u2019s output into a sum of contributions. This\nis accomplished by implementing a wrapper over PyTorch operations, allowing\nintermediate feature contributions to be propagated during a forward pass. Our\nimplementation supports various Shapley-based attribution methods and facili-\ntates approximation procedures such as (Generalized) Contextual Decomposition\nand Shapley sampling values, in addition to the exact computation of propagated\nShapley values. 3.2 Requirements\ndiagNNose can be installed using pip (pip install diagnnose) or cloned directly\nfrom the GitHub repository. The library is compatible with Python 3.6 or later,\nand its primary dependencies are PyTorch (v1.5+), torchtext, and HuggingFace\u2019s\ntransformers. It operates on both\nCPUs and GPUs and has been optimized for smaller consumer setups. The diagNNose codebase is fully typed using Python type hints and formatted\nusing Black. All methods and classes are documented, with an overview available\nonline. For our experiments, we analyze the\nfollowing models: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilRoBERTa, and an LSTM language\nmodel. These constructions feature an \"agreement attractor\" between the subject and the\nverb, which may mislead a language model into predicting the incorrect number of\nthe verb. Consequently, a model must possess a robust understanding of sentence\nstructure. Sentences are categorized\ninto multiple conditions based on the number of the subject and the intervening\nnoun phrase. To assess these corpora on a recurrent model, we initially compute the model\u2019s\nhidden state at the verb\u2019s position by feeding it the sub-sentence up to that point. To address this, we substitute the verb in\neach sentence with a <mask> token and evaluate the model\u2019s probabilities at this\ntoken\u2019s position. Therefore, in our experiments, we only\ncompare verb forms where both the plural and singular forms are split into a single\ntoken. 4.2 Targeted Syntactic Evaluations\nWe execute the targeted syntactic evaluation suite on all seven templates. Despite\nDistilRoBERTa being trained to mimic RoBERTa\u2019s behavior, its performance on\na downstream task like this differs considerably. This\nhighlights the differential impact of the intervening attractor on the verb\u2019s number. This logit is\ndecomposed into a sum of contributions, indicated at the bottom of each token. A negative value signifies a negative feature contribution to an output\nclass: the influence of that feature diminished the preference for the class. In the provided example sentence, DistilRoBERTa produces an incorrect prediction:\nthe logit of the incorrect singular form \u2019approves\u2019 is greater than that of the plural\n\u2019approve\u2019. The model\u2019s error in predicting the correct verb form arises from the\nsubject \u2019athletes\u2019 not providing sufficient contribution to outweigh the negative\ncontributions from other input features. A model with a comprehensive grasp of\nsubject-verb agreement should assign a larger contribution to the subject when\npredicting the main verb. The library\u2019s code is open-source, and contributions are encouraged.",
        "Results and Findings": "If a model assigns a higher\nprobability to the grammatical construction, it suggests an understanding of the\nrelevant linguistic principles. diagNNose supports a diverse set of syntactic tasks and offers an interface for\nincorporating new tasks seamlessly. **models:** We offer a generalized framework for language models, enabling\nboth recurrent and Transformer models to be accessed through a unified interface. Importing pre-trained Transformer models is accomplished using the transform-\ners library. 2**activations:** Extracted activations can be readily accessed using an Activation-\nReader, which provides access to activations corresponding to specific subsets of\ncorpus sentences. Individual attributes can also be directly set from the command line. 3.1.2 Analysis Modules\nWe presently offer three primary types of experimental modules. Based on this hidden state, we compute and compare the output probabilities of the\nverb with the correct number (vc) and the incorrect number (vx):\nP(vc | he) > P(vx | he)\nFor bi-directional masked language models, such as BERT, we cannot compute\nan intermediate hidden state by passing a sub-sentence because these models also\nincorporate input from future tokens.

        "Abstract": "GPT4Tools: Reimagining LLMs as Helpers\nAbstract\nThe objective of this research is to address the phenomenon of plasticity loss in\ndeep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, where neural networks lose their ability\nto learn effectively over time.",
        "Methodology": "Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or hyperparameter\ntuning, which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability. This approach offers a more\nefficient and adaptable solution compared to existing methods. Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or\nhyperparameter tuning [3, 4], which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution compared\nto existing methods, addressing the limitations of previous strategies that often involve extensive\nhyperparameter searches or complex architectural changes. The core innovation lies in its ability\nto proactively diagnose and mitigate plasticity loss without significantly increasing computational\ndemands. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for\nidentifying the onset and severity of plasticity loss within an RL agent. This diagnostic capability\nallows for proactive intervention before performance degradation becomes significant, preventing\ncatastrophic forgetting and maintaining consistent performance over extended training periods. The\ndiagnostic framework leverages novel metrics that capture subtle changes in network behavior,\nproviding early warning signals of impending plasticity loss. This proactive approach contrasts with\nreactive methods that only address plasticity loss after significant performance decline has already\noccurred. Second, plasticity injection mitigates plasticity loss without requiring an increase in the number of\ntrainable parameters or alterations to the network\u2019s prediction capabilities. This ensures that the\ncomputational overhead remains minimal while maintaining the integrity of the learned policy. This\nis achieved through a carefully designed mechanism that selectively modifies the network\u2019s internal\ndynamics rather than its overall architecture. This targeted approach minimizes the risk of disrupting\nthe agent\u2019s learned behavior while effectively addressing the underlying causes of plasticity loss. The preservation of prediction capabilities is crucial for maintaining the agent\u2019s performance in its\noperational environment. Third, the method dynamically expands network capacity only when necessary, leading to improved\ncomputational efficiency during training. This adaptive capacity allocation avoids unnecessary\nresource consumption during periods of stable performance. The dynamic expansion mechanism is\ntriggered by the diagnostic framework, ensuring that resources are allocated only when needed to\n.address emerging plasticity loss. This adaptive approach contrasts with static methods that allocate\nfixed resources regardless of the agent\u2019s learning dynamics, leading to potential inefficiencies. The effectiveness of plasticity injection is evaluated across a range of challenging RL benchmarks,\nincluding continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. The modular design of plasticity injection allows for easy integration with various RL\nalgorithms and architectures, enhancing its applicability and impact on the field. Further research\nwill explore its integration with other advanced RL techniques and its application to more complex\nreal-world scenarios. Traditional\napproaches to mitigate this issue often involve architectural modifications, such as employing separate\nnetworks for different tasks [3], or utilizing techniques like regularization and replay buffers [4, 5] to\npreserve previously learned knowledge. However, these methods can be computationally expensive,\nparticularly for large-scale RL agents, and may not always effectively prevent plasticity loss in\ncomplex scenarios. Furthermore, many existing methods focus on reactive solutions, addressing\nplasticity loss only after it has already occurred, rather than proactively preventing it. Our work differs\nsignificantly by introducing a proactive diagnostic framework coupled with a targeted intervention\nthat minimizes computational overhead. Several studies have explored the use of dynamic network architectures to improve the efficiency and\nadaptability of RL agents [6, 7]. These approaches often involve mechanisms for adding or removing\nneurons or layers based on the agent\u2019s performance or the complexity of the environment. However,\nthese methods typically focus on optimizing the network\u2019s overall structure rather than directly\naddressing the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss. In contrast, our plasticity injection method\nselectively modifies the network\u2019s internal dynamics without altering its overall architecture, allowing\nfor a more targeted and efficient approach to mitigating plasticity loss. This targeted approach avoids\nthe potential disruption of learned policies that can occur with more drastic architectural changes. The dynamic capacity expansion in our method is also triggered by a diagnostic framework, ensuring\nthat resources are allocated only when necessary, unlike many existing dynamic architecture methods\nthat may allocate resources inefficiently. Curriculum learning gradually\nintroduces increasingly complex tasks to the agent, allowing it to build a robust foundation of\nknowledge before tackling more challenging problems. Meta-learning aims to train agents that\ncan quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal training data. While these methods can indirectly\ncontribute to mitigating plasticity loss by improving the agent\u2019s overall learning stability, they do not\ndirectly address the specific mechanisms underlying the phenomenon. Our approach complements\nthese methods by providing a targeted intervention that directly tackles the root causes of plasticity\nloss, enhancing the effectiveness of existing training strategies. Our work draws inspiration from these neuroscientific findings, aiming to emulate the brain\u2019s ability\nto dynamically adjust its internal mechanisms to maintain learning capacity over time. However,\nunlike biological systems, our approach focuses on developing computationally efficient and scalable\nmethods for achieving this dynamic adaptation in artificial neural networks. The modular design\nof our plasticity injection framework allows for easy integration with various RL algorithms and\narchitectures, making it a versatile tool for enhancing the robustness and longevity of RL agents\nacross a wide range of applications. Future research will explore the integration of plasticity injection\n2with other advanced RL techniques, such as hierarchical RL and multi-agent RL, to further expand\nits applicability and impact. 3 Methodology\nThe core of our approach, termed \"plasticity injection,\" revolves around three interconnected compo-\nnents: a diagnostic framework, a mitigation strategy, and a dynamic capacity allocation mechanism. These components work in concert to proactively identify, address, and adapt to the onset of plasticity\nloss in RL agents. The diagnostic framework continuously monitors key network metrics during\ntraining, providing early warning signals of potential plasticity loss. These metrics are carefully\nselected to capture subtle changes in network behavior that might precede significant performance\ndegradation. We employ a combination of established metrics, such as learning rate decay and loss\nfunction fluctuations, alongside novel metrics specifically designed to detect subtle shifts in the\nnetwork\u2019s internal representations. These novel metrics are based on analyzing the distribution of\nactivations within different layers of the network, providing a more granular understanding of the\nnetwork\u2019s internal dynamics. The diagnostic framework outputs a plasticity\nscore, a continuous value reflecting the severity of detected plasticity loss. This score serves as a\ntrigger for the mitigation and capacity allocation mechanisms. Our mitigation strategy focuses on selectively modifying the network\u2019s internal dynamics rather than\nits overall architecture. This targeted approach avoids the computational overhead and potential\ndisruption of learned policies associated with architectural modifications. The strategy involves a\ncarefully designed set of operations applied to the network\u2019s weight matrices and biases. These\noperations are guided by the plasticity score, with stronger interventions applied when the score\nindicates a higher level of plasticity loss. The specific operations are chosen to enhance the network\u2019s\nability to learn new information without disrupting previously acquired knowledge. We explore\nseveral different operation types, including weight normalization, regularization techniques, and\ntargeted pruning of less relevant connections. The optimal set of operations and their parameters are\ndetermined through a hyperparameter search conducted on a subset of our benchmark tasks. The\neffectiveness of the mitigation strategy is evaluated by comparing the long-term performance of\nagents with and without plasticity injection. The dynamic capacity allocation mechanism complements the mitigation strategy by adaptively\nexpanding the network\u2019s capacity only when necessary. This mechanism is triggered by the plasticity\nscore, with the degree of capacity expansion directly proportional to the severity of detected plasticity\nloss. The capacity expansion is implemented by adding new neurons or layers to the network, with\nthe specific architecture of the added components determined based on the nature of the detected\nplasticity loss. This targeted approach ensures that resources are allocated\nefficiently, avoiding unnecessary computational overhead during periods of stable performance. The\nadded capacity is integrated seamlessly into the existing network architecture, minimizing disruption\nto the learned policy. The effectiveness of the dynamic capacity allocation is evaluated by comparing\nthe computational efficiency and long-term performance of agents with and without this mechanism. This modularity allows for flexibility and\nadaptability to different RL tasks and environments. The framework is designed to be computationally\nefficient, minimizing the overhead associated with diagnosis, mitigation, and capacity allocation. The\ncomputational efficiency is achieved through careful optimization of the algorithms and data structures\nused in each component. The framework\u2019s performance is evaluated across a range of challenging RL\nbenchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. Our experimental setup involves a rigorous evaluation across diverse RL environments, encompassing\nboth continuous control tasks and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We conduct experiments\nacross a diverse set of challenging RL environments, encompassing both continuous control tasks\nand partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). These environments represent a\nrange of complexities, requiring agents to adapt to varying degrees of uncertainty and dynamic\nchanges. The selection of these environments ensures a robust evaluation of the generalizability\nand robustness of our proposed method. The baselines are carefully selected to represent a range of existing approaches, allowing for\na comprehensive comparison. We meticulously control for confounding factors, such as hyperparameter settings\nand training procedures, to maintain the integrity of the experimental results. Long-term performance is measured by the average cumulative reward\nobtained by the agent over an extended training period. Learning stability is assessed by analyzing\nthe variance in the agent\u2019s performance over time, with lower variance indicating greater stability. Computational efficiency is evaluated by measuring the training time and resource consumption\nof the agents. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the overall effectiveness of\nplasticity injection. We utilize statistical tests, such as t-tests and ANOV A, to determine the statistical\nsignificance of the observed performance differences between the agents with and without plasticity\ninjection. To further analyze the effectiveness of each component of the plasticity injection framework, we\nconduct ablation studies. This allows us to gain a\ndeeper understanding of the interplay between the diagnostic framework, the mitigation strategy, and\nthe dynamic capacity allocation mechanism. These environments were chosen to represent a range of complexities and to\nrigorously test the generalizability of our approach. We compared the performance of RL agents\nutilizing plasticity injection against several state-of-the-art baselines, including those employing\nexperience replay [4, 5] and regularization techniques [3]. The baselines were carefully selected\nto represent a range of existing approaches for addressing catastrophic forgetting, allowing for a\ncomprehensive comparison. The evaluation metrics included long-term performance (average cumulative reward over 1000\nepisodes), learning stability (measured by the standard deviation of cumulative reward over the\nlast 200 episodes), and computational efficiency (training time and memory usage). Long-term\nperformance was chosen to directly assess the ability of the method to prevent plasticity loss over\nextended training. Learning stability was included to quantify the consistency of performance over\ntime. The\nsignificance level was set at \u03b1= 0.05for all statistical tests. To further analyze the contribution of each component of the plasticity injection framework, we\nconducted ablation studies. These studies involved systematically removing individual components\n(diagnostic framework, mitigation strategy, dynamic capacity allocation) and evaluating the resulting\nperformance. Removing any single component\nresulted in a substantial decrease in both average cumulative reward and learning stability, highlighting\n5the synergistic interaction between the components. The dynamic capacity allocation mechanism\nproved particularly crucial in maintaining computational efficiency while preventing performance\ndegradation in complex environments. The diagnostic framework effectively identified the onset\nof plasticity loss, allowing for timely intervention by the mitigation strategy.",
        "Results and Findings": "Our results demonstrate a\nconsistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines. The choice of metrics is informed by our preliminary experiments and\ntheoretical analysis of plasticity loss mechanisms. The results\ndemonstrate a consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines. We\ncompare the performance of RL agents employing plasticity injection against several state-of-the-art\nbaselines, including those utilizing established techniques for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. 3We analyze the results to assess the effectiveness of each component of the plasticity injection\nframework and to identify potential areas for future improvement. The detailed experimental results\nand analysis are presented in the Results section. 4 Experiments\nOur experimental evaluation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of plasticity injection in mitigating\nplasticity loss and enhancing the long-term performance of RL agents. We compare the performance of RL agents employing\nplasticity injection against several state-of-the-art baselines, including those utilizing established\ntechniques for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, such as experience replay and regularization\nmethods. The experimental setup is designed to isolate the effects of plasticity\ninjection, ensuring that any observed performance improvements can be directly attributed to our\nproposed method. The significance level is set at \u03b1= 0.05for all statistical tests. The detailed results of these\nstatistical analyses are presented in the following subsections. These studies involve systematically removing individual components of\nthe framework and evaluating the resulting performance. By comparing the performance of the full\nframework to the performance of the framework with individual components removed, we can isolate\nthe contribution of each component to the overall performance improvement. The results of these ablation studies provide valuable\ninsights into the design and optimization of the plasticity injection framework. The findings from\nthese studies inform future improvements and refinements to the framework.

        "Abstract": "Short-Term Forecasting of Precipitation Using Satellite Data\nAbstract\nShort-range forecasting of rain or snow, known as precipitation nowcasting, is typically displayed on geographical\nmaps by weather services for up to a 2-hour timeframe. GFS features are not used in this model.",
        "Methodology": "Current methods for precipitation nowcasting predomi-\nnantly use the extrapolation of ground-based radar observations, employing techniques like optical flow or neural\nnetworks. However, the effectiveness of these methods is geographically restricted to areas surrounding radar\ninstallations. This paper introduces a novel precipitation nowcasting technique that utilizes geostationary satellite\nimagery. This method has been integrated into the Yandex.Weather precipitation map, which includes an alert\nsystem with push notifications for Yandex ecosystem products. Additionally, partners and offline users, including radio and television, depend on this data, effectively doubling the\naudience for the precipitation nowcasting product. Moreover, traditional methods provide hourly updates, making it difficult to pinpoint brief periods without rain during short, intense\nprecipitation events. People often need straightforward answers to simple questions like when it will rain or stop raining, requiring\nspecific predictions such as \"heavy rain will start in 10 minutes and last for 30 minutes.\" Consequently, the current trend in nowcasting is to merge high-resolution radar data with traditional NWP\nmodels. The objective of this research is to develop and implement a practical system for precipitation nowcasting that relies on satellite\nimagery and NWP products. The goal is to replicate the precipitation fields obtained from radar using satellite data and then to\nprovide nowcasting over a much larger area using a similar predictive model. The system\u2019s effectiveness is validated by comparing\npredicted precipitation with data from ground-based weather stations. Since satellites do not directly observe rainfall, precipitation data must be extracted using heuristic or\nmachine learning methods. This paper concentrates on the binary classification approach to precipitation detection. These principles can be used to develop heuristics for detecting precipitation. One such implementation is the multi-sensor\nprecipitation estimate (MPE), which is, however, limited to detecting convective rain and may produce inaccurate results in\nareas with other forms of precipitation. During much of the year, frontal precipitation, driven by cyclonic movements and interactions between\nwarm and cold fronts, is more common. The MPE algorithm often fails to capture these frontal precipitation events. This algorithm uses radar observations to calibrate its parameters. However, because\nit relies on satellite observations at visible wavelengths to determine cloud properties, it can only retrieve precipitation data during\ndaylight hours. However, these studies often used pixel-wise data splits for training and testing, which may lead to overfitting due to neglecting\nthe spatial and temporal smoothness of atmospheric phenomena. Although the autoencoder\u2019s unsupervised training helps mitigate overfitting, there is\nno comparison with other architectures. Convolutional neural networks have become the standard for semantic segmentation\nin recent years, making them a natural choice for precipitation detection as well. A\ncommon issue in these datasets is the presence of objects of the same class at different scales, which has led to the development\nof multiscale approaches. However, these approaches are less applicable to precipitation detection and other satellite imagery\ntasks, as the distance between the sensor and the Earth\u2019s surface is usually known. Consequently, simpler models like UNet and\nfully-convolutional ResNet remain relevant. 2.2 Nowcasting\nPrecipitation nowcasting is typically accomplished in two stages by extrapolating radar observations. Initially, wind patterns are\nestimated by comparing multiple precipitation fields captured by radar. Subsequently, the precipitation field is moved according to the estimated\nwind directions. A novel approach to nowcasting using a convolutional recurrent neural network (Conv-LSTM) was introduced and later refined. While this neural network adds complexity, it can theoretically improve rainfall prediction accuracy by accounting for radar artifacts\nand the appearance or disappearance of precipitation areas. However, the most significant of these processes, the vanishing of\nprecipitation, can also be managed by adding basic filtering to the optical flow method. 3 Methodology\nThis section details the methodology used for precipitation detection and nowcasting, focusing on data preprocessing, model training,\nand evaluation metrics. Since no single source can fulfill all these\nrequirements, it is necessary to combine multiple data sources. Weather stations provide direct precipitation observations, typically measuring accumulated precipitation every 12 hours according\nto the SYNOP protocol. Although many stations report more frequently, usually every 3 hours, this frequency is insufficient for\nnowcasting due to the lack of detailed spatial and temporal data needed to generate high-resolution precipitation fields. Radar observations are the primary source of high-resolution precipitation data. The radar echo can be\nconverted to surface precipitation using the Marshall-Palmer relation. The resulting precipitation field has a resolution of 2 x 2 km,\nwith scans repeated every ten minutes. However, radar coverage is limited, especially outside densely populated areas of Europe and\nNorth America, with most Russian radars located in the western part of the country. These satellites\nscan a narrow band beneath their orbital path, offering global coverage in the sense that every location within a certain latitude range\nis eventually scanned. However, the time between consecutive passes of a single satellite can be quite long. However, at such altitudes, the only feasible instrument for cloud\nand precipitation detection is a high-resolution imager that captures visible and infrared spectrum snapshots. This paper describes a precipitation nowcasting system that integrates radar, satellite, and NWP model data. 3.2 Precipitation Detection\nThe approach to precipitation detection is summarized in Table 1. The key components of the pipeline are described in detail in the\nfollowing subsections. Radar data preprocessing begins by discarding radar observations taken beyond 200 km from the radar, as these are deemed\nunreliable. Subsequently, observations from various radars are consolidated onto a single map, resolving any conflicts between\nradars with overlapping coverage areas. Due to frequent false negatives in radar observations, the maximum value between two data\npoints is used for aggregation. Satellite images and radar observations are remapped onto a uniform grid using an equirectangular projection. However, in practice, accurately estimating precipitation height is complex, and accounting\nfor parallax did not improve the alignment. Satellite and radar data have different observation frequencies: satellite images are available every 15 minutes, while radar images\nare available every 10 minutes. To align these data sources temporally, a frame rate conversion is implemented using optical\nflow interpolation. The goal is to match the radar data\u2019s temporal resolution, so satellite data is converted to a 10-minute time\n3step. This issue is circumvented by performing precipitation detection before the optical\nflow step, allowing the optical flow to be computed directly from the precipitation detection results, which do not include the relief. To generate the missing image Itbetween two adjacent anchor images taken at times t0andt1, the following equation is used:\nIt(r) =aIt0(r+bu01) +bIt1(r+au10)\nwhere a=t1\u2212t\nt1\u2212t0andb=t\u2212t0\nt1\u2212t0are coefficients dependent on the time of the generated image, and u01andu10are the forward and\nbackward optical flows, computed using the TV-L1 optical flow algorithm implemented in OpenCV . Roshydromet radars record the timestamp at the end of a scan, whereas EUMETSAT marks the start. Since the Earth is scanned in a\nseries of lateral sweeps starting from the south, the actual observation time varies with latitude, with northern latitudes observed\nlast. The GFS model produces forecasts four times a day with a spatial resolution of 0.25 \u00b0x 0.25 \u00b0and temporal\nintervals of 3 hours. The model\nutilizes standard 3x3 convolutions, 2x2 pooling, and batch normalization layers. The number of channels begins at 16 in the first\nblock and doubles with each downsampling step. This reduced number of channels helps mitigate overfitting and accelerates training\nand evaluation. The network is trained for 250,000 iterations using the Adam algorithm, with an initial learning rate of 10\u22124, which is reduced by a\nfactor of 10 after 200,000 iterations. Training is performed using the Keras framework with a TensorFlow backend and Horovod for multi-GPU\nlearning. The model is trained to detect three levels of precipitation (light, medium, and heavy) simultaneously, producing three output maps\nwith binary classification loss applied to each map independently. Typically, precipitation estimation algorithms are developed separately for day, twilight, and night conditions. However, this\nseparation is challenging for machine learning in high-latitude zones due to the underrepresentation of night during summer and day\nduring winter, making it difficult to compile a balanced dataset. Therefore, a single model is trained, with solar altitude provided as\nan additional input feature. To address this, the model is trained on relatively small data crops (96x96 pixels). Due to the large number of channels in the input data, which is atypical for computer vision problems, data loading can be slow. To\nmanage this, a small batch of 5 multi-channel images (including all additional features) is loaded, and each image is then cropped 10\ntimes at random locations. Therefore, the primary metric used is the F1 score, averaged across temporal and spatial dimensions. - **UNet w/o GFS**: The\nsame UNet approach without GFS features. - **PP and MPE**: Physics-based algorithms\n(Precipitation Properties and Multi-sensor Precipitation Estimate). Given that PP and MPE algorithms are designed for daylight conditions, the metrics are also averaged separately for day, night, and\ntwilight periods. The generally poor performance of PP and MPE in these experiments may be due to their tuning for predicting convective\nrainfall aggregated over extended periods, which does not align with the requirements of this service. Two options are considered for this algorithm: extrapolation\nwith optical flow, as used for frame rate conversion, and a convolutional neural network previously developed for radar data\nprediction. The network consists of a sequence of blocks, each modeling the extrapolation process with optical flow via a spatial\ntransformer layer. Although the neural network\u2019s prediction mechanism is intentionally similar, end-to-end learning on real data\ntheoretically allows it to surpass the performance of simpler algorithms. Despite the optical flow approach being simpler and not requiring retraining with the introduction of new data sources, it is believed\nthat neural nowcasting remains promising and could outperform simpler techniques with proper tuning of the network architecture\nand training regimen. Therefore, the performance of the new precipitation map was\nassessed using ground station data. While the optimal metrics for a user-facing precipitation prediction algorithm are still debated,\nthere was evidence of the nowcasting product\u2019s popularity, and the aim was to replicate the properties of the radar-based precipitation\nmap using satellite data. The same comparison strategy was used to evaluate the performance of the new satellite-based\nrain detection algorithm over the federal districts of Russia. It is important to note that the radar located in Siberia was used only for verification at this stage; its data was not included in\nthe training dataset. This comparison allows for evaluating precipitation detection quality in regions without radar observation. Table 2: Comparison of precipitation detection methods with various metrics averaged over time. The system employs advanced machine learning algorithms and incorporates the physical\nproperties of the atmosphere and ground surface based on NWP models. The inclusion of satellite data enables nowcasting for areas\nnot covered by ground-based radars, achieving quality comparable to traditional radar-based nowcasts. 5Table 3: Comparison of F1 scores of precipitation detection methods during different time periods.

Scaling the technology to other\ngeostationary satellites with similar measurement systems, such as Himawari and GOES, offers the possibility of providing global\nprecipitation nowcasting and alerting services worldwide. However, differences in weather patterns across geographical regions will\nlikely necessitate retraining the detection model and adjusting the set of input features. 7 Acknowledgments\nThe success of this work and the product is attributed to the support, assistance, and hard work of a large team.

        "Results and Findings": "The integration of satellite imagery significantly\nbroadens the coverage area, marking a step towards developing a comprehensive global nowcasting service. Radar extrapolation products are effective for the first couple of hours but fail to predict precipitation accurately\ndue to physical processes. The primary focus areas with limited radar coverage are the\nSiberian and Ural federal districts of Russia, which have a combined population of approximately 30 million.2 Related Work\nThis section provides an overview of related work, divided into two main parts corresponding to the primary components of our\npipeline. Machine learning techniques, including decision trees, neural networks, and SVMs, have been evaluated for precipitation detection. While these studies examined day, twilight, and night conditions\nseparately, with the best results during the day, a more sophisticated method using a fully-connected stacked denoising autoencoder\nhas also been applied to precipitation detection. Each radar covers a circular\narea with a radius of up to 250 km and 10 km above the ground, with accuracy diminishing with distance. Low Earth orbit satellites equipped with radars and sensors provide another source of precipitation measurements. Positioned 35,786 km above the equator, these satellites match the\nEarth\u2019s rotation, allowing continuous monitoring of a large area. This study uses data from the Meteosat-8 satellite, operated by EUMETSAT, positioned over the Indian Ocean at 41.5 \u00b0longitude,\ncovering the western part of Russia and Europe. The SEVIRI instrument on Meteosat-8 scans the Earth\u2019s surface in 12 channels,\nwith a spatial resolution of 3 km per pixel and a full scan time of 15 minutes. A new approach to\nprecipitation detection is introduced and its accuracy is demonstrated. Table 1: Summary of our precipitation detection approach. Experimental validation has confirmed that this value\ncorresponds to the minimum discrepancy between radar data and precipitation field reconstruction. Additional features are incorporated into the satellite imagery to enhance the signal. Through testing, it was determined\nthat using 5 upsample/downsample blocks, compared to the original 4, yields the best results on the validation dataset. The addition of the Dice loss to the standard binary cross-entropy improves the F1 scores for\nthe converged model. Overfitting is a significant concern due to the limited geographical area of the dataset. Moreover, memorizing the correspondence between geographical location and output labels may cause the\nmodel to ignore areas outside radar coverage, leading to constant output in these regions. The neural network approaches consistently outperform the physics-based methods across all time periods and\nmetrics. 4The pointwise model\u2019s performance falls between that of UNet and the physics-based approaches. Since it is trained on radar data, it\ndetects similar types of precipitation and performs well during testing. Finally, the addition of GFS features further enhances the F1 score of the UNet model, as demonstrated in the results. While the neural network approach was found to be superior\nin the single radar setting, preliminary experiments did not show the same success with composited radar images and satellite data. 5 Results\n5.1 Post-Launch Performance\nAlthough the satellite-based rain detection model was trained to match radar fields, its reception by users was uncertain. Specifically, the radar data differs from longer-term forecasts based on proprietary Meteum technology in\nhaving higher accuracy and lower systematic error rates (precipitation imbalance) at the cost of a lower F1 score when compared to\nground station weather observations. Results showed that while the accuracy of the satellite-based product is\nlower than that of radar, it is still better than traditional forecasts, with precipitation imbalance and F1 scores similar to those for\nradar. Additionally, A/B testing on users showed a statistically significant increase\nin daily active users (DAU) in areas where the rain map was previously unavailable (Siberia and Ural regions), justifying its rollout\nin late September. Experiments with image blending to erase conflicting\nobservations along the border and inpainting the missing parts have been conducted.",
        "Conclusion": "Finally, radar observations are binarized using three thresholds: 0.08 mm/h for light rain, 0.5 mm/h\nfor moderate rain, and 2.5 mm/h for heavy rain.

        "Abstract": "Acquiring Cross-Domain Representations for\nContextual Detection Using Extensive Emoji Data\nAbstract\nThis research delves into the application of a vast collection of emoji occurrences\nto acquire versatile representations applicable to diverse domains for the purpose\nof identifying sentiment, emotion, and sarcasm. To enable others to\nexplore the prediction capabilities of our model, we have made an online demonstration available at\ndeepmoji.mit.edu.Our work makes the following contributions: We demonstrate that a vast number of readily accessible\nemoji occurrences on Twitter can be used to pre-train models for richer emotional representation than\nis typically achieved through distant supervision. Word coverage is defined as the percentage of words in the test dataset that were also\nseen in the training/pretraining dataset (as shown in Table 7).",
        "Methodology": "Our study demonstrates that by broadening distant\nsupervision to include a more varied array of noisy labels, models can achieve\nricher representations. This allows models to acquire valuable text representations before directly modeling\nthese specific tasks. The practice of using distant supervision on noisy labels often leads to enhanced performance in\nthe target task. In this paper, we present evidence that expanding distant supervision to a more\nvaried selection of noisy labels enables models to develop more detailed representations of emotional\ncontent in text. This, in turn, improves performance on benchmark datasets designed for the detection\nof sentiment, emotions, and sarcasm. We further demonstrate that the representations learned by a\nsingle pre-trained model can be successfully generalized across five different domains. We then transfer this learned knowledge to target\ntasks using a novel layer-wise fine-tuning approach. This technique yields significant improvements\nover state-of-the-art methods in areas such as emotion, sarcasm, and sentiment detection. Previous studies have always manually determined which emotional category\neach emotional expression should belong to. Such manual categorization necessitates an understanding of the emotional content inherent to each\nexpression, which can be challenging and time-consuming for complex emotional combinations. Furthermore, any manual selection and categorization carries the potential for misinterpretations\nand might overlook essential details concerning usage. In contrast, our methodology requires no\nprior knowledge of the corpus and can capture the diverse usage of 64 emoji types (Table 1 presents\nexamples, and Figure 3 shows how the model implicitly organizes emojis). An alternative approach to automatically interpreting the emotional content of an emoji involves\nlearning emoji embeddings from the words defining emoji-semantics, as found in official emoji tables. In our study, this approach has two significant limitations: (a) It requires emojis to be present during\ntesting, whereas several domains have limited or no emoji usage. Multi-task\nlearning, which involves training on multiple datasets at once, has been shown to have promising\nresults. However, multi-task learning requires access to the emoji dataset whenever the classifier\nneeds to be adjusted for a new target task. Requiring access to the dataset can be problematic when\nconsidering data access regulations. Instead, we use transfer learning which does\nnot require access to the original dataset. We used data from Twitter spanning from January 1, 2013, to June 1, 2017, but any\ndata set containing emoji occurrences could be used. The pretraining data set uses only English tweets that do not contain URLs. Because of this we expect emojis associated with tweets containing URLs to be noisier labels than\nthose in tweets without URLs, therefore the tweets with URLs have been removed. Proper tokenization is crucial for generalization. Words\ncontaining two or more repeated characters are shortened to the same token (for example, \u2018loool\u2019 and\n\u2018looooool\u2019 are tokenized as the same). We also use a special token for all URLs (which is relevant\nonly for the benchmark datasets), user mentions (for example, \u2018@acl2017\u2019 and \u2018@emnlp2017\u2019 are\ntreated the same), and numbers. To be included in the training set, a tweet must have at least one\ntoken that is not a punctuation mark, emoji, or special token. To address this in our training\ndata, for each unique emoji type, we save a separate tweet for pretraining, using that emoji type as\nthe label. Regardless of the number of emojis associated with the tweet, we save only a single tweet\nfor the pretraining for each unique emoji type. This pre-processing of data enables the pretraining to\ncapture that multiple kinds of emotional content can be associated with the tweet. To ensure that the pretraining encourages the models to learn a thorough understanding of the\nemotional content of text instead of just the emotional content associated with frequently used emojis,\nwe create a balanced pretraining dataset. The pretraining data is split into training, validation, and test\nsets. The validation and test sets are randomly sampled such that each emoji is represented equally. The remaining data is upsampled to generate a balanced training dataset. A hyperbolic tangent activation\nfunction is used to ensure each embedding dimension remains within the range [-1, 1]. To understand\neach word in the context of the text, we use two bidirectional LSTM layers with 1024 hidden units\neach (512 in each direction). The attention mechanism enables the model to determine the importance of each word for the\nprediction task by weighting the words as it creates the text representation. We use a\nbasic method, taking inspiration from prior work, with a single parameter for each input channel:\nei=hiwaai=exp(ei)P\nj=1exp(ej)v=X\naihi (1)\nHere, htstands for the representation of the word at time step t, and wais the weight matrix for\nthe attention layer. The attention importance scores for each time step, at, are determined by\nmultiplying the representations by the weight matrix, and then normalizing them to establish a\nprobability distribution across the words. Finally, the text\u2019s representation vector, v, is found using a\nweighted summation over all time steps, with the attention importance scores used as weights. The\nrepresentation vector that comes from the attention layer is a high-level encoding of the whole text. This is used as input into the final Softmax layer for classification. The only form of regularization used for the pretraining is L2 regularization with a coefficient of\n10\u22126on the embedding weights. For fine-tuning, further regularization is applied. Some methods involve\n\u2018freezing\u2019 layers by disabling parameter updates to prevent overfitting. One popular approach is\nto utilize the network as a feature extractor, where all model layers except the final one are frozen\nduring fine-tuning (we will call this the \"last\" approach). An alternative method is to use the pre-\ntrained model for initialization, where the full model is unfrozen (which we will refer to as the \u2018full\u2019\napproach). We put forward a new, simple transfer learning approach we are calling \"chain-thaw.\" This approach\nsequentially unfreezes and fine-tunes one layer at a time. It increases accuracy on the target task, but\nrequires more computational power for the fine-tuning process. By separately training each layer,\nthe model can adjust individual patterns across the network while reducing the risk of overfitting. It\nappears that this sequential fine-tuning has a regularizing effect, similar to the layer-wise training\nexplored for unsupervised learning. 3More specifically, the chain-thaw approach starts by fine-tuning any new layers (often only a Softmax\nlayer) to the target task until the validation set converges. Then, the approach individually fine-tunes\neach layer, starting with the first layer in the network. Each time the model converges (as measured on the validation set), the weights are restored to\ntheir optimal setting, preventing overfitting in a similar manner to early stopping. Figure 2 illustrates\nthis process. If only step a) in the figure is performed, this is the same as the \u2018last\u2019 approach, where\nthe existing network is used as a feature extractor. Likewise, only performing step d) is the same as\nthe \u2018full\u2019 approach, where the pre-trained weights are used as the initialization for a fully trainable\nnetwork. Also, the added time spent on fine-tuning is not large, when considering the use of\nGPUs on small datasets of manually annotated data which is often the case. For a given dataset, up to 10,000 new words from the training set are added to the\nvocabulary. The remaining tweets were used for the training set, which was\nbalanced using upsampling. We use both top 1 and top 5 accuracy for the evaluation as the emoji labels are noisy\nand multiple emojis can potentially be appropriate for a given sentence. For comparison purposes,\nwe also train a version of our DeepMoji model with smaller LSTM layers and a bag-of-words\nclassifier, fastText, which has recently shown competitive results. We use a 256 dimension vector\nfor the fastText classifier, making it almost identical to only using the embedding layer from the\nDeepMoji model. The value d refers to the\ndimensionality of each LSTM layer and the parameters are given in millions. 4.2 Benchmarking\nWe evaluate our method on 3 distinct NLP tasks using 8 datasets across 5 domains. For fair\ncomparison, DeepMoji is compared to other methods that utilize external data sources in addition\nto the benchmark dataset. We used an averaged F1 measure across classes for evaluating emotion\nanalysis and sarcasm detection, as these consist of unbalanced datasets. There has been\ncriticism regarding the use of correlation with continuous ratings as a measure, making only the\nsomewhat limited binary evaluation possible. We only evaluate the emotions Fear, Joy, Sadness\nbecause the remaining emotions are found in less than 5\nTo fully assess our method on emotion analysis, we make use of two other datasets. Second, a dataset of self-reported emotional experiences from a\nlarge group of psychologists. Because these two datasets have not been evaluated in prior work,\nwe compare against a state-of-the-art approach based on a valence-arousal-dominance framework. The scores extracted using this framework are mapped to the classes in the datasets using logistic\nregression with cross-validation parameter optimization. We assessed the performance of sentiment analysis using three benchmark datasets. These small\ndatasets were chosen to highlight the significance of the transfer learning capabilities of the evaluated\nmodels. This makes it difficult to replicate. As a substitute, we pre-train a model that\nuses the hyperparameters of the largest model in their ensemble on the positive/negative emoticon\ndataset. Using this pretraining as an initialization, we fine-tune the model on the target tasks, utilizing\nearly stopping based on a validation set. We implemented Sentiment-Specific Word Embeddings\n(SSWE), using embeddings available on the authors\u2019 website, but found that it performed worse than\nthe pretrained convolutional neural network, and these results have been excluded. Datasets that did not have pre-existing\ntraining/test splits were split by us, and these splits are publicly available. Data from the training set\nwas used for hyperparameter tuning. Datasets without pre-existing training/test splits are split\nby us (with splits publicly available). For sarcasm detection, we used versions 1 and 2 of the sarcasm dataset from the Internet Argument\nCorpus. We establish a state-of-the-art\nbaseline by modeling embedding-based features alongside unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams with\nan SVM. Cross-validation was used to perform a hyperparameter search for regularization parameters. The reported values are averages across\n5 runs. Reported values are averages across five runs. Variations refer to transfer learning approaches with \u2018new\u2019 being a model trained without pretraining. We used the Adam optimizer for training, with the gradient norm clipped to 1. For training all new\nlayers, we set the learning rate to 10\u22123and to 10\u22124when fine-tuning any pre-trained layers. To\nprevent overfitting on the small datasets, 10\nTable 5 demonstrates that the DeepMoji model outperforms the state of the art across all the benchmark\ndatasets and that our new \u2018chain-thaw\u2019 method yields the highest transfer learning performance. The\nresults are averaged across 5 runs to reduce the variance. Our model exceeds the performance of the state of the art even on datasets that come from different\ndomains than the tweets that the model was pre-trained on. The average number\nof tokens per tweet in the pretraining dataset is 11. Other studies used more nuanced sets of noisy labels, but our set is the most varied known to us. To\ninvestigate the effect of using a diverse set of emojis, we created a subset of our pretraining data that\nincluded tweets with one of 8 emojis, which are similar to the positive/negative emoticons used in\nother work. Because the dataset based on this reduced set of emojis contains 433 million tweets, any\nperformance differences on benchmark datasets are more likely linked to the diversity of the labels\nthan to differences in dataset sizes. We trained our DeepMoji model to predict whether tweets contained positive or negative emojis,\nand we evaluated this pre-trained model on benchmark datasets. To assess the emotional representations learned by the two pre-trained models, we used the\n\u2018last\u2019 transfer learning approach to allow the models to map already learned features to classes in the\n6target datasets. Reported values are averages across 5 runs. Reported values are the averages across five runs. By using hierarchical clustering on the correlation matrix of the DeepMoji model\u2019s\npredictions on the test set, we can see that the model captures many expected similarities (Figure 3). Here, we compare the DeepMoji\nmodel architecture to a standard 2-layer LSTM. We believe that the improvements in transfer learning can be attributed to two factors: (a) The\nattention mechanism with skip connections provides straightforward access to learned low-level\nfeatures for any time step, making it easy to use this information if needed for a new task. (b) The skip\nconnections improve the gradient flow from the output layer to the early layers in the network. Further analysis of these factors in future work would allow us to confirm why our architecture\noutperforms a standard 2-layer LSTM. Here,\nwe separate the effects of pretraining into two factors: word coverage and phrase coverage. These\ntwo effects provide regularization to the model, preventing overfitting (the supplementary material\nincludes a visualization of this regularization). Because of this, the test set\nmay contain language use not present in the training set. To examine this effect, we measure the improvement in word coverage on the test set when using\n7pretraining. One key reason that the \u2018chain-thaw\u2019\napproach outperforms other transfer learning approaches is its ability to tune the embedding layer\nwith a low risk of overfitting. Table 7 shows how adding new words to the vocabulary as part of the\ntuning process increased word coverage. In many small datasets, a\nword may occur only once in the training set. In contrast, all the words in the pretraining vocabulary\nare present in thousands or even millions of observations, enabling the model to learn a good\nrepresentation of the emotional and semantic meaning. This compares the use of only the vocabulary\ngenerated by finding words in the training data (\u2018own\u2019), the pretraining vocabulary (\u2018last\u2019), or a\ncombination of both vocabularies (\u2018full / chain-thaw\u2019). This fastText classifier is similar to only using the embedding\nlayer from the DeepMoji model. Each tweet was annotated by a minimum\nof 10 English-speaking Amazon Mechanical Turkers (MTurks) who lived in the USA. The tweets\nwere rated on a scale from 1 to 9, with a \u2018Do not know\u2019 option. Guidelines were provided to the\nhuman raters. The tweets were selected to contain only English text and no mentions or URLs, so\nthey could be rated without extra contextual information. Tweets where more than half the evaluators\nchose \u2018Do not know\u2019 were removed (98 tweets). For every tweet, we randomly select a single MTurk rating as the \u2018human evaluation.\u2019 We average the\nremaining nine MTurk ratings to make the ground truth. This enables them to acquire representations of emotional content in text.",
        "Results and Findings": "Through emoji prediction on a dataset encompassing 1,246\nmillion tweets, each including one of 64 prevalent emojis, we achieve state-of-\nthe-art results on eight benchmark datasets focusing on sentiment, emotion, and\nsarcasm detection, all with the aid of a singular pre-trained model. Our findings\naffirm that the diversity inherent in our emotional labels leads to an enhancement\nin performance compared to previous distant supervision methods. For every sentence, the five\nmost probable emojis are displayed, alongside the model\u2019s estimated probabilities. For instance, a\npositive emoji might clarify an ambiguous sentence or supplement text that might otherwise be\nseen as somewhat negative. While this is true, our results demonstrate that emojis can still be\nused to accurately categorize the emotional content of texts in numerous scenarios. Through\nextensive analyses on the influence of pre-training, our results highlight that the variety present in our\nemoji set plays a crucial role in the transfer learning capabilities of our model. We have made our\npre-trained DeepMoji model publicly available to aid in a range of NLP tasks. Initially, binarized emoticons served as noisy labels, but subsequent research has utilized\nhashtags and emojis. Therefore, pre-\ntraining a model to predict which emojis were initially part of a text can improve performance in the\ntarget task. We think the content\nobtained from the URL is important for understanding the emotional content of the text in the tweet. All tweets are tokenized word-by-word. 2Many tweets repeat the same emoji or contain multiple distinct emojis. Our DeepMoji model uses an embedding\nlayer with 256 dimensions to project each word into a vector space. We have found that the addition of\nthe attention mechanism and skip connections enhances the model\u2019s capabilities for transfer learning. 3.3 Transfer learning\nOur pre-trained model can be fine-tuned for a target task in several ways. The chain-thaw approach has the benefit of expanding the vocabulary to new domains with a low\nrisk of overfitting. We used\na validation set and a test set, both containing 640K tweets (10K of each emoji type), to evaluate\nperformance on the pretraining task. The difference in top 5 accuracy between the fastText classifier (36.2%) and the\nlargest DeepMoji model (43.8%) highlights the difficulty of the emoji prediction task.

        "Abstract": "Predictive Maintenance in Smart Grids Using\nTime-Series Analysis: A Multidisciplinary Approach\nto Enhance Grid Reliability\nAbstract\nPredictive maintenance in smart grids has become a crucial aspect of ensuring\nreliable and efficient energy distribution, and time-series analysis has emerged\nas a key approach in achieving this goal.",
        "Methodology": "By leveraging advanced statistical and\nmachine learning techniques, it is possible to analyze historical data and predict\npotential faults or failures in the grid, allowing for proactive maintenance and\nminimizing downtime. However, our research takes an unconventional approach\nby incorporating elements of chaos theory and fractal analysis to identify intricate\npatterns in the time-series data, which may not be immediately apparent through\ntraditional methods. This innovative methodology enables us to detect subtle\nanomalies and predict equipment failures with unprecedented accuracy, even when\nthe data exhibits seemingly erratic behavior. Furthermore, our approach also\ninvolves analyzing the grid\u2019s energy distribution patterns in relation to celestial\nevents, such as lunar cycles and solar flares, which have been found to have a\nsurprisingly significant impact on the grid\u2019s stability. The integration of these\ndiverse factors enables us to develop a comprehensive predictive maintenance\nframework that not only optimizes energy distribution but also provides a new\nperspective on the complex interplay between technological and environmental\nsystems. Time-series analysis\nhas emerged as a key enabler of predictive maintenance in smart grids, allowing grid operators to\nanalyze historical data and forecast future trends and patterns. By leveraging time-series analysis,\ngrid operators can detect anomalies, predict equipment failures, and schedule maintenance activities\nto minimize the risk of power outages and reduce maintenance costs. Furthermore, the analysis of time-series data often requires significant\ncomputational resources and expertise, which can be a barrier to adoption for smaller grid operators. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of predictive maintenance in smart grids are substantial,\nand researchers have been exploring a range of innovative approaches to improve the accuracy and\nefficiency of time-series analysis. This approach has been shown to\nbe particularly effective in predicting failures in complex systems, such as power transformers and\ntransmission lines. This approach has been shown to be particularly effective in predicting failures in systems\nthat are subject to high levels of uncertainty and variability. Another innovative approach to predictive maintenance involves the use of time-series data to train\nartificial intelligence models that can predict equipment failures and schedule maintenance activities. This approach has been shown to be highly effective in a range of applications, including predictive\nmaintenance of wind turbines and power generation equipment. By training artificial intelligence\nmodels on historical time-series data, grid operators can identify patterns and relationships that are\nnot apparent through traditional analysis techniques, and use this information to inform predictive\nmaintenance activities. While these approaches may seem unorthodox, they have been shown to be\nhighly effective in certain applications, and highlight the potential for innovation and creativity in the\nfield of predictive maintenance. The use of unorthodox approaches to time-series analysis is not without its challenges, however. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of innovative approaches to time-series\nanalysis are substantial, and researchers continue to explore new and unconventional methods for\nanalyzing and interpreting time-series data. From\ntraditional methods, such as autoregressive integrated moving average models, to more innovative\napproaches, such as fractal theory and chaos theory, researchers continue to push the boundaries\nof what is possible in predictive maintenance. While there are certainly challenges to be addressed,\nthe potential benefits of predictive maintenance in smart grids are substantial, and the continued\ndevelopment of innovative approaches to time-series analysis will be critical to realizing these\nbenefits. A\nconsiderable body of work has focused on leveraging traditional machine learning algorithms, such\nas autoregressive integrated moving average models and exponential smoothing, to forecast energy\ndemand and detect potential grid anomalies. However, these approaches often fall short in capturing\nthe intricate complexities and nonlinearities inherent in smart grid operations. 2Some researchers have explored the application of more advanced techniques, including deep learning\narchitectures and ensemble methods, to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictive mainte-\nnance models. Although the\nresults were intriguing, with the fractal dimension appearing to correlate with peak demand periods,\nthe methodology was not without its criticisms, as some argued that the underlying assumptions\nwere flawed and the analysis was overly simplistic. Furthermore, a separate study took a decidedly\nunorthodox approach, using a combination of astrology and machine learning to predict energy\ndemand, with the authors claiming that lunar cycles and planetary alignments had a tangible impact\non grid operations. Moreover, the increasing prevalence of renewable energy sources and distributed generation has\nintroduced new complexities and challenges to predictive maintenance in smart grids. As such,\nresearchers have begun to explore the development of more sophisticated time-series analysis tech-\nniques, incorporating elements of uncertainty quantification and robust optimization to account for\nthe inherent variability and intermittency of renewable energy sources. Additionally, the integration\nof advanced sensor technologies and IoT devices has enabled the collection of vast amounts of data,\nwhich can be leveraged to develop more accurate and informative predictive models. The proliferation of smart grid technologies has also led to an increased focus on the development\nof more advanced data analytics platforms, capable of handling the vast amounts of data generated\nby these systems. As such, researchers have begun to explore the application of big data analytics\nand cloud computing to predictive maintenance, leveraging the scalability and flexibility of these\nplatforms to develop more comprehensive and integrated models. While\nsome methods have yielded promising results, others have been met with criticism and skepticism. Nevertheless, the continued development and refinement of these techniques is crucial to the efficient\nand reliable operation of smart grids, and it is likely that future research will yield even more\ninnovative and effective solutions to the challenges posed by predictive maintenance. 3 Methodology\nPredictive maintenance in smart grids is a complex task that involves analyzing time-series data from\nvarious sources, including sensors, meters, and other monitoring devices. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose a multi-step approach that combines traditional time-series analysis techniques with\nsome unconventional methods. First, we collect and preprocess the data by handling missing values,\nremoving outliers, and normalizing the time series. This step is crucial in ensuring that the data is\nconsistent and reliable, which is essential for accurate predictions. This approach may seem unorthodox, but it has been shown to reduce the noise in the data\nand improve the overall quality of the time series. Next, we apply various time-series analysis techniques, including autoregressive integrated moving\naverage (ARIMA) models, exponential smoothing (ES), and seasonal decomposition. These methods\nhelp us identify patterns and trends in the data, which are essential for predicting future values. This approach\nmay seem bizarre, but it has been shown to provide interesting insights into the underlying dynamics\nof the system. In addition to these traditional and unconventional methods, we also propose a new framework for\npredictive maintenance in smart grids. This framework involves using a combination of machine\nlearning algorithms, including neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines. These\nalgorithms are trained on the preprocessed data and are used to predict the likelihood of equipment\nfailure or other maintenance-related events. However, we also introduce a new algorithm called\n\"random guessing,\" which involves randomly selecting a prediction from a set of possible outcomes. This approach may seem illogical, but it has been shown to provide surprisingly accurate results in\ncertain situations. To further improve the accuracy of our predictions, we propose a novel technique called \"human-\nmachine collaboration.\" This involves collaborating with human experts in the field of predictive\nmaintenance to validate and refine the predictions made by the machine learning algorithms. However,\nwe also introduce a new approach called \"machine-machine collaboration,\" which involves using\nmultiple machines to collaborate with each other to make predictions. The proposed framework also involves using a variety of evaluation metrics to assess the performance\nof the predictive maintenance system. These metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score,\nwhich provide a comprehensive overview of the system\u2019s performance. However, we also propose a\nnew metric called \"predictive maintenance happiness index,\" which involves measuring the overall\nsatisfaction of the maintenance personnel with the predictions made by the system. This approach\nmay seem irrelevant, but it has been shown to provide valuable insights into the human factors that\ninfluence the adoption and effectiveness of predictive maintenance systems. Overall, the proposed methodology provides a comprehensive framework for predictive maintenance\nin smart grids using time-series analysis. The combination of traditional and unconventional methods,\nmachine learning algorithms, and human-machine collaboration provides a powerful approach for\npredicting equipment failure and other maintenance-related events. The dataset was carefully\ncurated to include diverse seasonal and climatic conditions, thereby ensuring the robustness and\ngeneralizability of our model. We commenced our experiments by applying a range of time-series analysis techniques, including\nautocorrelation analysis, spectral analysis, and wavelet analysis, to identify underlying patterns and\ntrends in the power consumption data. To further enhance the accuracy of our model, we employed a novel approach involving the use of\nfractal geometry to analyze the self-similarity of power consumption patterns at different temporal\nscales. This unconventional method allowed us to uncover intricate patterns and structures in the data\nthat would have otherwise remained undetected. In addition to these innovative approaches, we also investigated the application of traditional machine\nlearning algorithms, such as support vector machines and random forests, to predict maintenance\nneeds based on time-series data. Ultimately, our research contributes to\nthe growing body of knowledge in the field of predictive maintenance, providing new insights and\nperspectives on the application of time-series analysis in smart grids. To further elucidate the complex relationships between power consumption patterns, lunar cycles,\nand unicorn airspeed velocity, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the spectral properties of the\ntime-series data. This involved the application of advanced signal processing techniques, including\nshort-time Fourier transforms and wavelet packet decomposition, to extract relevant features and\npatterns from the data. By analyzing the Lyapunov exponents\nand fractal dimensions of the power consumption time series, we were able to identify early warning\nsigns of impending maintenance needs, thereby enabling proactive measures to be taken to prevent\npotential outages and disruptions. This innovative approach has significant implications for the\ndevelopment of more resilient and reliable smart grid systems, and underscores the importance of\nconsidering complex, nonlinear dynamics in the analysis of time-series data. The unexpected relationships and patterns uncovered in our research have\nsignificant implications for the field of predictive maintenance, and underscore the need for continued\ninnovation and exploration in this rapidly evolving area of research. The use of\nvirtual reality technology also allowed for a high level of customization, with participants able to\ntailor their therapy experience to their individual needs and preferences.",
        "Results and Findings": "For example, an artificial intelligence model trained on time-series data from\na wind turbine can predict the likelihood of gear box failure, and schedule maintenance activities to\nminimize downtime and reduce maintenance costs. One\nof the primary difficulties is the lack of a theoretical framework to support these approaches, which\ncan make it difficult to interpret and validate the results. For instance, a study employed a hybrid approach combining long short-term memory\nnetworks with wavelet transform to forecast energy consumption patterns, yielding remarkably\naccurate results. In a rather unconventional approach, a team of investigators attempted to apply the principles of fractal\ngeometry to model the self-similar patterns inherent in energy demand time series. While the results were largely inconclusive and sparked intense debate, the\nstudy did serve to highlight the importance of considering external factors in predictive maintenance\nmodels. In a surprising turn of events, a research team discovered that the application of certain types of\nmusic, specifically classical compositions with a strong emphasis on rhythm and melody, appeared to\nhave a profound impact on the accuracy of predictive maintenance models. While the findings\nwere met with a mix of amusement and skepticism, they did serve to highlight the often-overlooked\nimportance of creativity and intuition in the development of predictive maintenance models. Moreover, the use of advanced\nvisualization techniques, such as virtual and augmented reality, has been proposed as a means of\nfacilitating more effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders, allowing for more\ninformed decision-making and improved predictive maintenance outcomes. For example, we found that the alignment of the planets has a significant impact on the\nelectricity demand during peak hours. For example, we found that the collaboration between two machines can lead to the discovery\nof new patterns and trends in the data that were not visible before. While some of the approaches\nmay seem unorthodox or flawed, they have been shown to provide interesting insights and accurate\npredictions, which can be used to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of smart grids. 4 Experiments\nIn order to validate the efficacy of our proposed time-series analysis framework for predictive\nmaintenance in smart grids, we conducted an exhaustive set of experiments on a comprehensive\ndataset comprising power consumption patterns from various regions. Our experimental setup consisted of a simulated smart grid environment,\nwhere we mimicked real-world power distribution scenarios using advanced computational tools. Notably, our autocorrelation analysis revealed a peculiar\nphenomenon, wherein the power consumption patterns exhibited a strong correlation with the lunar\n4cycle, particularly during periods of full moon. This unexpected finding prompted us to explore the\npotential relationship between lunar cycles and power consumption, which led us to incorporate lunar\nphase data into our predictive model. Moreover, we discovered that the fractal dimensions\nof the power consumption time series were inversely proportional to the frequency of maintenance\noutages, suggesting a previously unknown relationship between the complexity of power consumption\npatterns and the reliability of the grid. However, our results showed that these conventional methods\nwere outperformed by our proposed time-series analysis framework, which achieved a remarkable\nprediction accuracy of 97.42\nThe following table summarizes the results of our experiments, highlighting the performance of our\nproposed framework in comparison to traditional machine learning approaches: Our findings suggest\nTable 1: Comparison of Predictive Maintenance Models\nModel Prediction Accuracy Mean Absolute Error Root Mean Squared Error\nProposed Framework 97.42% 2.15 3.17\nSupport Vector Machine 82.11% 4.21 5.67\nRandom Forest 85.67% 3.93 5.23\nFractal Geometry Approach 91.25% 2.97 4.13\nthat the incorporation of unconventional variables, such as unicorn airspeed velocity, and innovative\napproaches, like fractal geometry analysis, can significantly enhance the predictive performance of\nmaintenance models in smart grids. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of considering\nunexpected relationships and patterns in time-series data, which can lead to the development of more\naccurate and reliable predictive maintenance frameworks. Our analysis revealed a fascinating phenomenon, wherein the spectral\ncharacteristics of the power consumption time series were found to be intimately related to the\nharmonic frequencies of the lunar cycle, with a notable peak in spectral power corresponding to the\nfull moon phase. 55 Results\nThe results of our study show a significant reduction in symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD) among military veterans who underwent virtual reality (VR)-enhanced therapy.

As shown in Figure 2, AF has three components: data (i.e., examples with multiple\noptions, one of which is correct), a discriminator LM (a classifier that is used to solve each example)\nand a generator LM (a model that generates new options for an example). Comparing Tables 2 and 3, we can see that the data\nthe generator LM is fine-tuned on is not part of DISCOSENSE. Abstract associations. 14 percent of the errors are made due to the formation of abstract associations\nbetween concepts. d) In a kind of perverse way, I\ndon\u2019t really feel sad.",
        "Methodology": "State-of-the-art LMs\nhave achieved or even surpassed human performance on numerous commonsense downstream tasks. Nevertheless, these LMs are still very far from being able to perform commonsense reasoning as well\nas humans. Hence, the fact that they have begun to ace existing benchmarks implies that time is ripe\nto design a new challenging benchmark that can reliably target their limitations. d) For some customers, this is fine. The correct (i.e., most\nplausible) option is boldfaced. Once we consider both the context\nand the discourse connective, then it is clear that only option b) is plausible. Since \u201cHowever\u201d signals a\nCONTRAST relation, options a) and d) both seem viable. Specifically, option a) describes a situation\nin which she did not forget the writer\u2019s stuff. Nevertheless, option a) is arguably more plausible than\noption d) and should be chosen. Without this assumption, it may\nbe strange for other customers to have an opinion on her forgetting the writer\u2019s stuff. In general, the\nmost plausible option is the option that makes the smallest number of assumptions, and/or is the most\ncoherent given the context and the discourse connective. Considering the commonsense knowledge\nand the reasoning involved, it should not be difficult to see that this task is challenging. Second, we employ a\ncontrolled text generation based adversarial filtering approach to generate compelling negatives. 2 Related Work\nIn this section, we discuss related work, focusing our discussion on the differences between DIS-\nCOSENSE and existing commonsense reasoning benchmarks. There are benchmarks that aim to test different kinds of commonsense reasoning abilities, although\nnone of them focuses on reasoning over discourse connectives. MCTACO and TIMEDIAL focus on temporal reasoning in comprehension and dialogue formats. P-MCQA focuses exclusively on reasoning with PRECONDITION rela-\ntions: given a commonsense fact, select the precondition that make the fact possible (enabling) or\nimpossible (disabling) out of four options. The pear is \u201d, the goal is to fill in the blank with one of two choices\n(e.g., \u201dedible\u201d, \u201dinedible\u201d). Specifically, as some connectives are sense-ambiguous\n(e.g., the connective \u201csince\u201d may serve as a temporal or causal connective), a LM will likely need to\n(implicitly) perform sense disambiguation in order to perform well on DISCOSENSE. There are datasets and knowledge bases where the semantic/discourse/commonsense relations are\nexplicitly annotated and which can provide data sources from which commonsense reasoning bench-\nmarks can be derived. In each AF iteration, the\ndiscriminator LM is trained on the training set and used to solve each example in the test set. Training a new discriminator LM in each AF iteration ensures that\nthe dataset is not just adversarial for one LM but a class of LMs, as training different instances of\nthe same type of LMs results in models that have differently learned linguistic representations. The correct endings can be obtained after understanding\nthe purpose of the given discourse connectives. Details of how the DISCOVERY and\nDISCOFUSE sentences are used to create DISCOSENSE are shown in Tables 2 and 3. 3.3 Generating Options\nNext, we describe how we generate challenging options for DISCOSENSE using an improved version\nof AF that we call Conditional Adversarial Filtering (CAF). One examines how to steer generation by fine-tuning an extra set of parameters while\nkeeping the base (unconditionally trained) model fixed while the other involves conditionally training\na generative model on a control variable to generate text w.r.t. We adopt the latter\n4approach, extending CTRL to explicitly steer generation w.r.t. Specifically, each input context for CTRL is prepended with a\nconnective, and the training task for CTRL is to learn the conditional distribution p(e|d, context)\nover possible endings e. The predicted ending is then compared with the human generated ending to\ncompute loss. Since the original CTRL model is pre-trained with control codes suitable for openended\ntext generation, we fine-tune CTRL on the portion of DISCOVERY shown in Table 3 using all the\n174 connectives present in the selected splits. Doing so ensures that the endings\ngenerated by the generator LM are different from the ground truth (i.e., the human written endings). We use Nucleus sampling for generating options for the training set with the value of p set\nto 0.7, which means the\nweights of the tail of the probability distribution are ignored (i.e., tokens with a cumulative probability\nmass of less than 0.3 are left out). Additionally, we use a length penalty of 0.8 to restrict the length of\nthe generations to match the average length of the ground truth to avoid the induction of length bias. Efficacy of conditional generation. Recall that we propose the use of conditional generation, specifi-\ncally the use of discourse connectives as control codes, in our generator LM because of our hypothesis\nthat the resulting LM would generate options that are more compliant with the purpose of the dis-\ncourse connective. To test this hypothesis, we compare the text generation capability of CTRL\nwith that of GPT2-XL, a model that is trained unconditionally and has nearly the same number of\nparameters (1.6B) as CTRL, under the same evaluation setting. Specifically, both LMs are fine-tuned\non the same data (see Table 3) using the same machine (a 2x Quadro RTX 8000 with a batch size\nof 24). CTRL achieves a much lower perplexity than GPT2-XL (2.39 vs. 2.53),\nwhich suggests that conditional training improves the quality of the generated sentences. 3.3.2 Discriminator LM\nWe use ROBERTA-LARGE as the discriminator LM, which takes the context, the discourse connec-\ntive, and the four endings as input and predicts the most plausible ending. This LM is trained on the\nrandomly shuffled training split of DISCOSENSE and applied to the DISCOSENSE test set to get\nthe confidence scores associated with its predictions. Rather than generating options for examples that\ncontain any of these 174 connectives, we select 37 discourse connectives and generate options only\nfor examples that contain one of them. The connectives that are discarded are primarily those that\nimpose few constraints on the endings to be gen-\nerated given the context according to preliminary experiments. For instance, the connective \u201cand\u201d\nis discarded because numerous endings are equally plausible. The 37\nconnectives that we end up choosing are shown in Table 4. To generate the options for these 94k sentences, we begin by training 20 generator LMs on a\nrandomly shuffled order of the generators\u2019 training data (see Table 3) and then inserting them into a\ncircular queue. Although the underlying data is the same, random shuffling ensures that the learned\nrepresentations of these 20 models are different. Since each example needs to have 3 synthetic\noptions, we use the first 3 generator LMs from the circular queue to generate the initial options for\neach example. In each CAF iteration, we (1) train the discriminator LM\n(see Section 3.3.2) on the DISCOSENSE training set for 4 epochs and use it to filter out the options\ndeemed as easiest by the discriminator LM; and (2) use the next generator LM in the circular queue\nto generate the options for the examples whose easiest option is removed by the discriminator LM. In\nother words, a different discriminator LM is used in each CAF iteration, and a generator LM in the\ncircular queue is used once every 20 CAF iterations. These models are trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning\nrate of 2e-5. The training of each generator LM is performed on a 2x Quadro RTX 8000 with a batch\nsize of 24 and typically lasts for 3 days. The training of a discriminator LM is performed on a RTX\n3090 with a batch size of 16 and typically lasts for 5\u20136 hours. 3.4 Human Verification\nNext, we perform human verification of the examples for which we have generated options. In Step 1, we ask three human verifiers to independently identify\nthe correct option for each example, removing an example if at least one person fails to identify the\ncorrect option. In Step 2, we ask three human verifiers not involved in Step 1 to independently\nidentify the correct option for each of the 13,056 examples verified in Step 1. We compute for\neach verifier the accuracy of choosing the correct option and use the average accuracy as the human\nperformance on DISCOSENSE. Appendix A contains the details on how the human verifiers are\nrecruited and the annotation instructions we present to them. The number of unique tokens\nprovides a rough characterization of the richness of the vocabulary. First,\nwe consider models that are pre-trained in a BERT-like fashion and share architectural similarities,\nincluding the base and large variants of BERT and ROBERTA, as well as ALBERT-XXLARGE-V2. As an extension, we select LONGFORMER BASE, which is pre-trained in the same manner as\nROBERTA but has a sparse attention matrix. For\nmodels trained with a different pre-training objective, we experiment with ELECTRA-LARGE and\nFUNNEL-TRANSFORMER-XL, the latter of which is pre-trained in a similar manner as ELECTRA-\nLARGE. We fine-tune them on\nthe DISCOSENSE training set using a 4way cross-entropy loss in the same way as the discriminator\nLMs in CAF are trained (see Section 3.3.4) and evaluate them on the test set. Second, models sharing a similar pre-training objective as that of BERT, such as ROBERTA and\nLONGFORMER, are among the worst baselines. Although\n7ALBERT has the Masked Token Prediction task in its pre-training objective, its architectural differ-\nences (i.e., larger hidden states and parameter sharing) and its Sentence Order Prediction objective\nseem to help it learn inter-sentence coherency properties better than its BERT counterparts. Third, pre-training appears to play a predominant role in our task. While the BERT family of models\nare trained with the masked-LM objective, the pre-training objective of ELECTRA (the best baseline)\nis designed to determine if a token in a human-written sentence has been replaced by a generator. We\nspeculate that ELECTRA\u2019s superior\nperformance can be attributed to the fact that its pretrained knowledge of discriminating between syn-\nthetic and human generated tokens transfers well to the task of discriminating between synthetically\ngenerated sentences and human written sentences in DISCOSENSE. Details of how these numbers are\nobtained are discussed in Section 3.4. Specifically,\nwe compute for each discourse connective the percentage of examples in the DISCOSENSE test\nset that are misclassified by ELECTRA, with the goal of gaining a better understanding of the\ndiscourse connectives that are perceived as easy as well as those that are perceived as difficult as far\nas commonsense reasoning is concerned. As we can see,\nthe misclassification rates are highest for those discourse connectives that express contrast (e.g.,\n\u201cotherwise\u201d, \u201chowever\u201d, \u201cbut\u201d, \u201calthough\u201d). Choosing a less plausible option could be associated with a partial\nunderstanding of the context or unwarranted assumptions. The model seems to rely on certain spans of context for classification rather than\nunderstand the semantics in its entirety. c) It does make me want to back up and ask even bigger questions. make a person do, in this case, \u201cask bigger questions\u201d. In the first experiment, we remove the discourse\nconnective, so only the context and the endings are available to the LMs.",

Table 1 shows the best accuracies achieved by existing LMs on 10 widely used commonsense rea-\nsoning benchmarks and the corresponding human performance levels. On the other hand, if a test example\nis correctly solved, then AF seeks to increase its difficulty by replacing the easiest option (i.e., the\ngenerated option that the discriminator LM classifies with the highest confidence) with a new option\ngenerated by the generator LM. 3.2 Dataset Creation\nTo assemble DISCOSENSE, we focus on source datasets that contain two sentences connected through\na discourse connective. Since these datasets contain sentences from\nCommon Crawl and Wikipedia articles, DISCOSENSE is diverse in the topics it covers. Importantly,\nsince by construction the discourse connective is crucial in solving the underlying tasks (i.e., sentence\nrepresentation learning and sentence fusion), the crucial role played by the discourse connectives\nin these sentences makes them suitable for our use case. Hence, to be able to generate sentences that are coherent with not\nonly the context but also the discourse connective, we propose to use Controllable Text Generation,\nwhich aims to provide a more granular control over how generation happens to match a particular\nattribute. a prompt prefix. 3.3.3 Generating Options\nNext, we describe how we generate options for the examples in DISCOSENSE.

        "Conclusion": "Finally, we show the\nefficacy of using DISCOSENSE as a transfer learning resource through sequential fine-tuning of\nLMs on DISCOSENSE followed by HELLASWAG and achieve near state-of-the-art results on the\nHELLASWAG test set.

Traditional\napproaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as the availability of multiple proxy variables [1,\n2] or the imposition of restrictive functional forms on the relationships between variables [3]. These\nassumptions can be difficult to justify in practice, limiting the applicability of these methods. Our approach offers a significant advantage by\nrelaxing these stringent requirements. Several recent works have explored the use of proxy variables for handling latent confounding [6,\n7]. However, these methods often require multiple proxies, which can be challenging to obtain in\nmany real-world applications. Furthermore, the performance of these methods can be sensitive to\nthe quality and number of proxies used. In contrast, our method leverages a single proxy variable,\nmaking it more practical and robust to the limitations of proxy data. The use of cross-moments\nto extract additional information from the observed data is a key innovation that distinguishes our\napproach from existing methods. However,\nthese methods often focus on specific model structures or make strong assumptions about the data\ngenerating process. Our approach provides a more general framework that can handle a wider range\nof scenarios. The theoretical guarantees we provide offer a solid foundation for the reliability and\nvalidity of our method, addressing a critical gap in the existing literature. This rigorous theoretical\nanalysis distinguishes our work from purely empirical approaches. Many existing methods struggle with the computational complexity\nassociated with high-dimensional data, limiting their applicability to large-scale datasets. This scalability\nis achieved through the efficient use of cross-moments and the development of computationally\nefficient algorithms. The ability to accurately estimate causal effects in the presence of latent con-\nfounders is crucial for many applications, ranging from healthcare to social sciences. Our method\u2019s\nability to handle latent confounders with a single proxy variable, coupled with its robustness and\nscalability, represents a significant advancement in the field. The development of user-friendly\nsoftware implementing this algorithm will further enhance its accessibility and impact. 3 Methodology\nOur proposed method leverages a single proxy variable and cross-moments to identify and estimate\ncausal effects in linear Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with latent confounders. Unlike existing\nmethods that often require multiple proxy variables or strong assumptions, our approach offers a\nmore practical and robust solution. The core idea is to exploit the information contained in the\ncross-moments of the observed variables to disentangle the direct effect of the treatment from\nthe indirect effect mediated by the latent confounder. This is achieved by carefully analyzing\nthe relationships between the observed variables and the single proxy variable, allowing us to\neffectively account for the unobserved confounding. The algorithm is designed to be robust to\nmodel misspecification and capable of handling high-dimensional data, making it suitable for a\nwide range of real-world applications. Furthermore,\nthe algorithm\u2019s theoretical foundations are rigorously established, providing strong guarantees on\nits performance and reliability. The theoretical analysis ensures that the estimated causal effects are\nconsistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions. This rigorous theoretical framework\ndistinguishes our approach from purely empirical methods. The algorithm\u2019s design incorporates techniques to mitigate the impact of\nnoise and model misspecification, leading to more accurate and stable estimates. First, we estimate the cross-moments of the observed\nvariables, including the treatment, outcome, and proxy variable. These cross-moments capture the\ncomplex relationships between the variables and provide crucial information for identifying the causal\neffect. The estimation of these cross-moments is performed using robust statistical techniques that are\nresistant to outliers and noise. The choice of estimation method is crucial for ensuring the accuracy\nand robustness of the subsequent steps. We employ a method that is both efficient and robust to outliers\nand noise, ensuring reliable estimates even in the presence of noisy data. The second step involves\nsolving a system of equations derived from the estimated cross-moments. This system of equations is\ncarefully constructed to leverage the information contained in the cross-moments to identify the causal\neffect. The solution to this system of equations provides an estimate of the causal effect, accounting\nfor the latent confounder. The solution is obtained using efficient numerical methods that are designed\nto handle potential numerical instabilities. The third step involves constructing confidence intervals\nfor the estimated causal effect. This step provides a measure of uncertainty associated with the\nestimate, allowing for a more complete understanding of the results. The confidence intervals are\nconstructed using asymptotic theory, providing valid inferences even in large samples. The entire\nprocess is designed to be computationally efficient, allowing for the analysis of large datasets. The consistency result ensures that the estimator converges to the true\ncausal effect as the sample size increases. The asymptotic normality result allows for the construction\nof valid confidence intervals, providing a measure of uncertainty associated with the estimate.

        "Methodology": "It highlights the potential for misuse in\nsurveillance technologies and proposes various strategies to counter these threats,\nemphasizing the need for collaboration between machine learning experts and\nhuman-computer interaction (HCI) researchers. While privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy offer\npotential solutions, some machine learning systems, particularly those designed for biometric analysis\nor behavioral profiling, inherently compromise individual privacy. Therefore, there is a crucial need\nto explore methods beyond these traditional approaches. This research provides an overview of strategies developed to combat privacy-threatening machine\nlearning systems and advocates for increased collaboration between the machine learning community\nand experts in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). Two main approaches are discussed:\nfirst, challenging the data that feeds these models through obfuscation or data withholding, and\nsecond, directly challenging the model itself through public pressure or regulation. This paper\nsuggests that computer scientists have an important role to play in both these approaches. 2 Challenging Data\nMachine learning systems depend on data for both training and operation. Data is used to train\nmachine learning models, and new data is fed into the models to generate predictions. These training\nand deployment stages can be iterative; models can be updated using new data over time. One way to\noppose a machine learning system is by disrupting the data it relies on. However,\nthese approaches often lack strong guarantees. Additionally, some vendors sell clothing designed to trigger automated license\nplate readers by injecting junk data, furthering this method. These acts serve a dual purpose of\nboth evading surveillance and protesting against its use. This can be achieved through\nprivacy-enhancing technologies that block web tracking. These methods go\nbeyond simple evasion, using the act of withholding data as a way to launch broader campaigns\nagainst surveillance systems. There are many\nforms that regulation can take and many roles that computer scientists can play in this process. One method of pressuring companies that develop surveillance technologies is through auditing. However, audits do have limitations, as they can sometimes normalize\nharmful tasks for certain communities. Nevertheless, these systems can\nsometimes be reverse-engineered to show potential societal harms. Researchers have partnered with community organizations to resist surveillance technologies, debunk-\ning the myth that critics do not understand the technology, and demystifying complex algorithms. It\nis important for researchers to approach these collaborations with humility, as community organizers\nbring their own areas of expertise. It is also crucial to recognize the academic community\u2019s role in creating and upholding surveillance\ntechnologies. Computer science educators should make computing\u2019s role in injustice more visible. It emphasizes the need for participatory methods when developing anti-surveillance technologies. 2While these participatory methods are common in HCI research, the machine learning community\nhas paid less attention to it. Therefore, it is critical that the design of anti-surveillance technologies\nbe led by those who are most affected.",
        "Results and Findings": "In an era of powerful algorithms and massive datasets, maintaining privacy is\nincreasingly challenging, given that facial recognition systems can identify individuals in public\nspaces, targeted advertising can exploit user profiles, and predictive policing algorithms can single\nout individuals for surveillance. Research audits of facial recognition systems have shown they perform poorly on darker-skinned\nsubjects, which has led to wrongful arrests. These audits have led some companies to stop selling\nfacial recognition technology. Student-led efforts can help educate future computer scientists about the consequences of their work.",

        "Abstract": "End-to-End Neural Discourse Deixis Resolution in\nDialogue\nAbstract\nWe adapt a span-based entity coreference model to the task of end-to-end discourse\ndeixis resolution in dialogue, specifically by proposing extensions to their model\nthat exploit task-specific characteristics. 1 Introduction\nDiscourse deixis (DD) resolution, also known as abstract anaphora resolution, is an under-investigated\ntask that involves resolving a deictic anaphor to its antecedent. Some utterances are pragmatic in nature and do not\nconvey any important information. As\nin Extension E6, we will enforce this constraint, which we will refer to as C2, in a soft manner by\ndefining a penalty function p2, as shown below:\np2(i) =\u001aoti(NA)\u2212oti(A)ifarg max y\u2208Ys(i, y)\u0338=\u03f5andti=NA\n0 otherwise(10)\nThen we redefine s(i, j)when j\u0338=\u03f5as follows:\ns(i, j) =s(i, j)\u2212[\u03b34p2(i)] (11)\nwhere \u03b34is a positive constant that controls the hardness of C2. 7 Further Analysis\nAn example is analyzed. B: Uh in Yep, I just got\nA: Okay.",
        "Methodology": "The resulting model, dd-utt, achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on the four datasets. DD resolution is potentially\nmore challenging than entity coreference resolution because (1) DD resolution involves understanding\nclause semantics, which are arguably harder to encode than noun phrase semantics; and (2) string\nmatching plays little role in DD resolution, unlike in entity coreference. Recently, a re-implementation of a span-based entity coreference model has been applied to resolve\nthe deictic anaphors in the DD track after augmenting it with a type prediction model. First, we investigate whether task-specific observations can be\nexploited to extend a span-based model originally developed for entity coreference to improve\nits performance for end-to-end DD resolution in dialogue. test 22 3652 1996 166.0 9.6 90.7 12.0 14.7 2.0\n2 Related Work\nBroadly, existing approaches to DD resolution can be divided into three categories, as described\nbelow. Early systems that resolve deictic expressions are rule-based. Specifically, they use predefined rules to extract anaphoric mentions, and select antecedent\nfor each extracted anaphor based on the dialogue act types of each candidate antecedent. \u2022Non-neural learning-based approaches. Early non-neural learning-based approaches to\nDD resolution use hand-crafted feature vectors to represent mentions. A classifier is then\ntrained to determine whether a pair of mentions is a valid antecedent-anaphor pair. In addition, motivated by the recent successes of Transformer-based approaches\nto entity coreference, a Transformer-based approach to DD resolution has recently been\nproposed, which is an end-to-end coreference system based on SpanBERT. 3 Corpora\nWe use the DD-annotated corpora provided as part of the shared task. For validation and evaluation, we use the official development sets and test sets from the shared\ntask. 4 Baseline Systems\nWe employ three baseline systems. The model ranks all text spans of up to a predefined length based on how likely they\ncorrespond to entity mentions. For each top-ranked span z, the model learns a distribution P(y)over\nits antecedents y\u2208 Y(z), where Y(z)includes a dummy antecedent \u03f5and every preceding span:\nP(y) =es(z,y)\nP\ny\u2032\u2208Y(z)es(z,y\u2032)(1)\nwhere s(x, y)is a pairwise score that incorporates two types of scores: (1) sm(\u00b7), which indicates\nhow likely a span is a mention, and (2) sc(\u00b7)andsa(\u00b7), which indicate how likely two spans refer to\n2the same entity ( sc(z, \u03f5) =sa(z, \u03f5) = 0 for dummy antecedents):\ns(z, y) =sm(x) +sm(y) +sc(z, y) +sa(z, y) (2)\nsm(\u00b7) =FFNN m(gz) (3)\nsc(z, y) =gT\nxWcgy (4)\nsa(z, y) =FFNN a([gx, gy, gx\u2299gy, \u03d5(x, y)]) (5)\nwhere gxandgyare the vector representations of xandy,Wcis a learned weight matrix for bilinear\nscoring, FFNN (\u00b7)is a feedforward neural network, and \u03d5(\u00b7)encodes features. Two features are used,\none encoding speaker information and the other the segment distance between two spans. It extends coref-hoi with a set of modifications. Two of the most important modifications are:\n(1) the addition of a sentence distance feature to \u03d5(\u00b7), and (2) the incorporation into coref-hoi\na type prediction model, which predicts the type of a span. The possible types of a span iare:\nANTECEDENT (if icorresponds to an antecedent), ANAPHOR (if icorresponds to an anaphor),\nand NULL (if it is neither an antecedent nor an anaphor). The types predicted by the model are then\nused by coref-hoi as follows: only spans predicted as ANAPHOR can be resolved, and they can only\nbe resolved to spans predicted as ANTECEDENT. Thethird baseline , coref-hoi-utt, is essentially the first baseline except that we restrict the candidate\nantecedents to be utterances. This restriction is motivated by the observation that the antecedents of\nthe deictic anaphors in the datasets are all utterances. 5 Model\nNext, we describe our resolver, dd-utt, which augments coref-hoi-utt with 10 extensions. Modeling recency. To model recency, we restrict the set of candidate antecedents of an anaphor to be the utterance\ncontaining the anaphor as well as the preceding 10 utterances, the choice of which is based on our\nobservation of the development data, where the 10 closest utterances already cover 96\u201399% of the\nantecedent-anaphor pairs. Modeling distance. While the previous extension allows us to restrict our attention to candidate\nantecedents that are close to the anaphor, it does not model the fact that the likelihood of being\nthe correct antecedent tends to increase as its distance from the anaphor decreases. Since s(x, y)is used to\nrank candidate antecedents, modeling utterance distance by updating s(x, y)will allow distance to\nhave a direct impact on DD resolution. Modeling candidate antecedent length. Ideally, the model can\nidentify such utterances and prevent them from being selected as antecedents. We hypothesize that\nwe could help the model by modeling such utterances. To do so, we observe that such utterances\ntend to be short and model them by penalizing shorter utterances. Specifically, we subtract the term\n\u03b321\nLength (y)from s(x, y), where Length (y)is the number of words in candidate antecedent yand\u03b32\nis a tunable parameter that controls the importance of candidate antecedent length in resolution. Extracting candidate anaphors. As mentioned before, the deictic anaphors in dialogue are\nlargely composed of pronouns. Specifically, in our development sets, the three pronouns \u201cthat\u201d,\n\u201cthis\u201d, and \u2018it\u2019 alone account for 74\u201388% of the anaphors. Consequently, we extract candidate deictic\nanaphors as follows: instead of allowing each span of length nor less to be a candidate anaphor, we\nonly allow a span to be a candidate anaphor if its underlying word/phrase has appeared at least once\nin the training set as a deictic anaphor. Predicting anaphors. Now that we have the candidate anaphors, our next extension involves\npredicting which of them are indeed deictic anaphors. To do so, we retrain the type prediction model\nin UTD_NLP, which is a FFNN that takes as input the (contextualized) span representation giof\ncandidate anaphor iand outputs a vector otiof dimension 2 in which the first element denotes the\nlikelihood that iis a deictic anaphor and the second element denotes the likelihood that iis not a\ndeictic anaphor. Following UTD_NLP,\nthis type prediction model is jointly trained with the resolution model. Specifically, we compute the\ncross-entropy loss using oti, multiply it by a type loss coefficient \u03bb, and add it to the loss function of\ncoref-hoi-utt. \u03bbis a tunable parameter that controls the importance of type prediction relative to DD\nresolution. Modeling the relationship between anaphor recognition and resolution. To alleviate\nerror propagation, we instead enforce C1 in a soft manner. To do so, we define a penalty function p1,\nwhich imposes a penalty on span iif C1 is violated (i.e., a deictic anaphor is resolved to the dummy\nantecedent), as shown below:\np1(i) =\u001a0 ifarg max y\u2208Ys(i, y) =\u03f5andti=NA\noti(A)\u2212oti(NA)otherwise(8)\nIntuitively, p1estimates the minimum amount to be adjusted so that span i\u2019s type is not ANAPHOR. We incorporate piinto the model as a penalty term in s(Equation (1)). Specifically, we redefine\ns(i, \u03f5)as shown below:\ns(i, \u03f5) =s(i, \u03f5)\u2212[\u03b33p1(i)] (9)\nwhere \u03b33is a positive constant that controls the hardness of C1. Modeling the relationship between non-anaphor recognition and resolution. Another\nconsistency constraint that should be enforced is that the model should resolve a candidate anaphor\nto the dummy antecedent if it is predicted as a non-deictic anaphor by the type prediction model. While these span representations are contextualized,\nthe contextual information they encode is arguably limited. As noted before, most of the deictic\nanaphors in dialogue are pronouns, which are semantically empty. As a result, we hypothesize that\nwe could improve the resolution of these deictic anaphors if we explicitly modeled their contexts. Encoding the relationship between candidate anaphors and antecedents. Similar to the previous extension, we hypothesize that we could\nbetter encode the relationship between xandyusing additional features. Specifically, we incorporate\nan additional feature into \u03d5(x, y)that encodes the utterance distance between xandy. In coref-hoi-utt, a candidate antecedent is simply encoded\nusing its span representation. We hypothesize that we could better encode a candidate antecedent\nusing additional features. Specifically, we employ seven features to encode a candidate antecedent y\nand incorporate them into \u03d5(x, y): (1) the number of words in y; (2) the number of nouns in y; (3)\nthe number of verbs in y; (4) the number of adjectives in y; (5) the number of content word overlaps\nbetween yand the portion of the utterance containing the anaphor that precedes the anaphor; (6)\nwhether yis the longest among the candidate antecedents; and (7) whether yhas the largest number of\ncontent word overlap (as computed in Feature #5) among the candidate antecedents. Despite this redundancy,\nwe believe the redundant information could be exploited by the model differently and may therefore\nhave varying degrees of impact on it. We express recognition results in terms of Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-score, con-\n5Table 3: Resolution and recognition results on the four test sets. Model training and parameter tuning. Since we do not rely on span enumerate to generate\ncandidate spans, the maximum span width can be set to any arbitrary number that is large enough\nto cover all candidate antecedents and anaphors. In our case, we use 300 as our maximum span\nwidth. We tune the parameters (i.e., \u03bb, \u03b3 1, \u03b32, \u03b33, \u03b34) using grid search to maximize CoNLL score on\ndevelopment data. All models are trained for 30 epochs with a dropout rate of 0.3 and early stopping. Each experiment is run using a\nrandom seed of 11 and takes less than three hours to train on an NVIDIA RTX A6000 48GB. Since we have four test sets, we use ARRAU and all dev sets other than\nthe one to be evaluated on for model training and the remaining dev set for parameter tuning. For\nexample, when evaluating on AMItest, we train models on ARRAU, LIGHTdev, Persuasiondev and\nSwitchboarddev and use AMIdev for tuning. Since coref-hoi and coref-hoi-utt do not explicitly identify\ndeictic anaphors, we assume that all but the first mentions in each output cluster are anaphors when\ncomputing recognition precision; and while UTD_NLP (the top-performing system in the shared\ntask) does recognize anaphors, we still make the same assumption when computing its recognition\nprecision since the anaphors are not explicitly marked in the output (recall that we computed results\nof UTD_NLP based on its outputs). 6We test the statistical significance among the four models using two-tailed Approximate Random-\nization. For resolution, dd-utt is highly significantly better than the baselines w.r.t. Not surprisingly, \u201cthat\u201d is the most frequent deictic anaphor on the test sets, appearing as an\nanaphor 402 times on the test sets and contributing to 68.8% of the anaphors. This is followed by \u201cit\u201d\n(16.3%) and \u201cthis\u201d (4.3%). Only 8.9% of the anaphors are not among the top four anaphors. This is not surprising either: \u201cthis\u201d,\nwhen used as a pronoun, is more likely to be deictic than \u201cit\u201d, although both of them can serve as\na coreference anaphor and a bridging anaphor. In other words, it is comparatively more difficult to\ndetermine whether a particular occurrence of \u201cit\u201d is deictic. Overall, UTD_NLP recognizes more\nanaphors than the other models. To obtain the CoNLL scores for a given anaphor, we retain all\nand only those clusters containing the anaphor in both the gold partition and the system partition and\napply the official scorer to them. Generally, the more frequently occurring an anaphor is, the better\nits resolution performance is. Interestingly, for the \u201cOthers\u201d category, dd-utt achieves the highest\nresolution results despite having the lowest recognition performance. In contrast, while UTD_NLP\nachieves the best recognition performance on average, its resolution results are among the worst. In terms of MUC F-score, the performance difference between dd-utt and the\nsecond best resolver on each dataset is substantial (2.2%-14.9% points). Nevertheless, the anaphor extraction precision achieved by\ndd-utt is often one of the highest in each dataset. UTD_NLP fails to extract \"that\"\nas a deictic anaphor. While coref-hoi correctly extracts the anaphor, it incorrectly selects \"You want\nyour rating to be a two?\" From a cursory look at this example, one could infer that\nthis candidate antecedent is highly unlikely to be the correct antecedent since it is 10 utterances away\nfrom the anaphor. As for coref-hoi-utt, the resolver successfully extracts the anaphor but incorrectly\nselects \"Its just two point five for that one\" as the antecedent, which, like the antecedent chosen by\ncoref-hoi, is farther away from the anaphor than the correct antecedent.

A common type of recognition precision errors involves\nmisclassifying a coreference anaphor as a deictic anaphor. This type of error occurs\nbecause virtually all of the frequently occurring deictic anaphors, including \"that\", \"it\", \"this\", and\n\"which\", appear as a coreference anaphor in some contexts and as a deictic anaphor in other contexts,\nand distinguishing between the two different uses of these anaphors could be challenging. DD anaphor recognition recall errors . Consider the second example in Figure 2, in which \"it\" is a\ndeictic anaphor that refers to the boldfaced utterance, but dd-utt fails to identify this and many other\noccurrences of \"it\" as deictic, probably because \"it\" is more likely to be a coreference anaphor than a\ndeictic anaphor: in the dev sets, 80% of the occurrences of \"it\" are coreference anaphors while only\n5% are deictic anaphors. DD resolution precision errors . While dd-utt correctly identifies \"that\" as a deictic anaphor, it erroneously posits the\nitalicized utterance as its antecedent. However, when\nboth the boldfaced utterance and the italicized utterance are taken into consideration, it is clear that\nthe boldfaced utterance is the correct antecedent for \"that\" because winning over seven awards for\nsome charitable work is certainly more surprising than seeing a place bring awareness to the needs of\nthe young. Correctly resolving this anaphor, however, requires modeling the emotional implication of\nits context.",
        "Results and Findings": "Lexical overlap is a strong indicator of entity coreference, both among names (e.g.,\n\u201cPresident Biden\u201d, \u201cJoe Biden\u201d) and in the resolution of nominals (e.g., linking \u201cthe president\u201d to\n\u201cPresident Biden\u201d). While the deictic anaphors in dialogue are also\ncomposed of pronouns and nominals, the proportion of pronominal deictic anaphors in dialogue is\nmuch higher than that in narrative text. Not only\ndid they achieve the highest score on each dataset, but they beat the second-best system, which is a\nnon-span-based neural approach combined with hand-crafted rules, by a large margin.

These results suggest that\nbetter link identification, which is what the MUC F- score reveals, is the primary reason for the\nsuperior performance of dd-utt. These results seem to suggest that the performance gap between\ndd-utt and the other resolvers tends to widen as the difficulty of a dataset increases.

        "Abstract": "Xray Emissions and their Consequential Effects on\nCroissant Pastry Dough Fermentation Dynamics\nAbstract\nThe utilization of xray technology has led to a profound understanding of cheese\nproduction, which in turn has influenced the development of quantum mechanics,\nparticularly in the realm of interdimensional travel, where the consumption of\ncaffeine has been shown to enhance the visibility of invisible socks, meanwhile\nthe aerodynamics of flying pancakes have been observed to affect the growth rate\nof ferns on the planet Neptune, where xray beams are used to study the art of\nplaying the trombone underwater. To address this, we turned to the\nfield of ancient Greek philosophy, specifically the concept of Platonic realism, which posits that\nabstract entities such as numbers and geometric shapes have a real, albeit immaterial, existence. This discovery has\nsignificant implications for a range of fields, including biotechnology, medicine, and environmental\nscience, and suggests a range of potential applications in areas such as xray-based fungal biocontrol,\nxray-induced bioremediation, and xray-mediated environmental monitoring. Furthermore, the observation of xray-induced bacterial morphogenesis has significant\nimplications for our understanding of the complex, nonlinear interactions between xray radiation,\nbacterial biology, and the environment, and suggests a range of potential applications in fields such\nas biotechnology, medicine, and environmental science. To facilitate the analysis of xray-induced bacterial morphogenesis, a custom-built, xray-emitting\nmicroscope was designed and constructed, utilizing a novel, xray-based imaging technique herein re-\nferred to as \"xray-induced fluorescence microscopy\" (XIFM). The development\nof xray technology, however, has been marked by a range of challenges and controversies, including,\nbut not limited to, the debate over the safety of xray radiation, the development of xray-based medical\nimaging techniques, and the use of xray technology in non-medical applications, such as security\nscreening and materials analysis.",
        "Methodology": "In recent years, the study of xray has become increasingly interdisciplinary, incorporating insights and\nmethods from a wide range of fields, including physics, biology, chemistry, and mathematics. This\ninterdisciplinary approach has led to a greater understanding of the complex relationships between\ndifferent phenomena, and has shed light on the intricate web of connections that underlies many\ncomplex systems. This has led to a renewed interest in the application of xray technology to the\nfield of literary analysis, with potential breakthroughs in the development of new methods for the\ninterpretation and understanding of complex texts and literary works. Furthermore, the application of xray technology to the field of materials science has led to a greater\nunderstanding of the underlying principles of xray and its potential applications in the development of\nnew technologies and products, from energy storage devices to medical implants and prosthetics. Moreover, the xray has been\nfound to have a profound\n3 Methodology\nThe methodology employed in this study was largely influenced by the art of baking croissants,\nwhich involves a delicate balance of ingredients and techniques to produce a flaky, yet crispy, texture. Similarly, our approach to analyzing xray data required a nuanced understanding of the intricacies\ninvolved in signal processing, as well as a deep appreciation for the works of 19th-century French\nimpressionist painters. Initially, we began by examining\nthe properties of various types of cheese, including mozzarella, cheddar, and feta, in order to better\nunderstand the role of casein in xray image formation. Furthermore, this approach allowed\nus to incorporate elements of cognitive psychology and sociology into our analysis, as we recognized\nthat the interpretation of xray data is often influenced by social and cultural factors. In addition to the theoretical underpinnings of FCA, our methodology also involved the development\nof a custom-built xray imaging system, which we dubbed the \"XRS-1000.\" The system\u2019s development was a truly interdisciplinary effort, involving contributions\nfrom materials scientists, computer programmers, and even a professional snail trainer. The application of FCA to xray image analysis has numerous potential benefits, including improved\ndiagnostic accuracy, enhanced materials characterization, and even the possibility of detecting\nhidden patterns and structures in xray data. To explore these possibilities, we conducted a series of\nexperiments using the XRS-1000, which involved imaging a diverse range of samples, from human\nbones and teeth to metallic foils and even a fragment of the Wright brothers\u2019 Flyer. In conclusion, the methodology employed in this study represents a major breakthrough in the field of\nxray physics, and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the underlying mechanisms\ngoverning xray image formation. The use of FCA and the XRS-1000 has also allowed us to explore the properties of xray waves in\nnew and innovative ways, including the study of xray diffraction, scattering, and refraction. This calibration enabled the research team to accurately measure the\nxray absorption coefficients of various cheese samples, which, in turn, revealed a heretofore unknown\ncorrelation between xray opacity and the moisture content of cheese. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying xray-induced mycelial morphogenesis, a series of\nexperiments were conducted utilizing a custom-built, xray-emitting apparatus designed to mimic\nthe spectral characteristics of celestial xray sources, such as black holes and neutron stars. In an effort to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving the formation of mycelial vortices, a series\nof computational simulations were conducted utilizing a novel, xray-based algorithm designed to\nmodel the complex, nonlinear interactions between xray radiation, fungal biology, and the surrounding\nenvironment. In an effort to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving the formation of xray-induced bacterial\nmorphological features, a series of computational simulations were conducted utilizing a novel,\nxray-based algorithm designed to model the complex, nonlinear interactions between xray radiation,\nbacterial biology, and the surrounding environment. The xray diffraction patterns obtained from a sample of ancient Egyptian papyrus, which was\npurportedly used by a secret society of pharaonic priests to record their most sacred and mystical\nknowledge, revealed a striking resemblance to the geometric patterns found in the architecture of\nmodern skyscrapers, which, as we all know, are designed by a cabal of visionary architects and\nengineers, and whose underlying mathematical structures, in turn, were shown to be intimately\nconnected to the theoretical frameworks of quantum mechanics and the culinary art of preparing the\nperfect souffl\u00e9, thereby highlighting the profound and mysterious relationships that exist between the\nrealms of xray physics, ancient history, and haute cuisine. As we move forward, however, it is essential that we remain\ncognizant of the potential risks and challenges associated with xray technology, including, but not\nlimited to, the dangers of xray-induced radiation poisoning, the environmental impact of xray-based\nindustrial processes, and the ethical implications of using xray technology for non-medical purposes,\nsuch as the creation of xray-based surveillance systems or xray-induced mind control devices.

The xray\ninduced effects on the molecular structure of water have been observed to influence\nthe sentence structure of literary novels, and the xray imaging of historical artifacts\nhas revealed a hidden connection between ancient civilizations and the modern-day\nmanufacturing of dental floss, all of which are deeply intertwined with the xray\ntechnology.

As we continued to analyze the xray data, we began to notice a series of anomalous features and\nartifacts that appeared to be related to the FCA algorithm itself. Furthermore, the XRS-1000 has allowed us to investigate the properties of xray waves in extreme\nenvironments, such as high-temperature plasmas and intense magnetic fields, which has shed new\nlight on the behavior of xray waves in these regimes. The results of our experiments have been nothing short of astonishing, revealing complex patterns\nand relationships that had previously gone unnoticed. Similarly, we have found that the xray waves produced\nby the XRS-1000 exhibit a unique, fractal-like structure, which is characterized by self-similarity and\nscaling behavior over a wide range of lengths and frequencies. The implications of these findings are far-reaching and profound, suggesting that xray imaging may\nbe more than just a passive, observational technique, but rather an active, participatory process that\ninvolves a complex interplay between the xray source, the sample, and the observer. Furthermore, the implementation of a novel xray-emitting device, herein referred\nto as the \"X-3000,\" facilitated the acquisition of data pertaining to the opacity of various types of\ncheeses, including, but not limited to, gouda, cheddar, and a previously undocumented variety of blue\ncheese discovered in the remote regions of rural Bulgaria. Conversely, this discovery\nprompted an exploratory analysis of the role of xray radiation in the desiccation process of cheese,\nleading to a series of experiments involving the xray-induced dehydration of cheese samples. In a complementary study, the effects of xray radiation on the growth patterns of fungal hyphae\nin various types of cheese were investigated, yielding a fascinating insight into the phenomenon\nof \"xray-induced mycelial morphogenesis.\" Moreover, the observation\nof xray-induced mycelial morphogenesis led to a series of experiments exploring the potential\napplications of xray technology in the development of novel, xray-resistant fungal strains with\npotential uses in the fields of bioremediation and astrobiology. These\nexperiments, which involved the exposure of fungal samples to controlled doses of xray radiation,\nyielded a wealth of data on the effects of xray radiation on fungal growth patterns, including the\nunexpected discovery of a novel, xray-induced morphological feature herein referred to as the\n\"mycelial vortex.\" These simulations, which incorporated a range of variables, including xray intensity,\nfrequency, and duration, as well as fungal species, temperature, and humidity, yielded a wealth of\ndata on the dynamics of mycelial vortex formation, including the unexpected discovery of a critical,\nxray-induced threshold beyond which mycelial vortices undergo a sudden, catastrophic transition to a\nstate of chaotic, turbulent growth. Furthermore, the XIMVT phenomenon has prompted a re-examination of the role of xray radiation\nin the evolution of fungal species, leading to a series of experiments exploring the potential for\nxray-induced, adaptive radiation in fungi, and the possible emergence of novel, xray-resistant fungal\nstrains with enhanced capabilities for survival and growth in xray-rich environments. To facilitate the analysis of xray-induced mycelial vortex formation, a custom-built, xray-emitting\nmicroscope was designed and constructed, utilizing a novel, xray-based imaging technique herein re-\nferred to as \"xray-induced fluorescence microscopy\" (XIFM). In addition to the xray-induced mycelial vortex transition, the research team also investigated the\neffects of xray radiation on the growth patterns of bacterial colonies, yielding a fascinating insight\ninto the phenomenon of \"xray-induced bacterial morphogenesis.\" Moreover, the observation of xray-\ninduced bacterial morphogenesis led to a series of experiments exploring the potential applications of\nxray technology in the development of novel, xray-resistant bacterial strains with potential uses in\nfields such as bioremediation and astrobiology. The discovery of xray-induced bacterial morphogenesis has also prompted a re-examination of\nthe role of xray radiation in the evolution of bacterial species, leading to a series of experiments\nexploring the potential for xray-induced, adaptive radiation in bacteria, and the possible emergence of\nnovel, xray-resistant bacterial strains with enhanced capabilities for survival and growth in xray-rich\nenvironments. These simulations, which incorporated a range of\nvariables, including xray intensity, frequency, and duration, as well as bacterial species, temperature,\nand humidity, yielded a wealth of data on the dynamics of xray-induced bacterial morphogenesis,\nincluding the unexpected discovery of a critical, xray-induced threshold beyond which bacterial\ncolonies undergo a sudden, catastrophic transition to a state of chaotic, turbulent growth. Furthermore, the XIBMT phenomenon has prompted a re-examination of the role of xray radiation\nin the evolution of bacterial species, leading to a series of experiments exploring the potential for\nxray-induced, adaptive radiation in bacteria, and the possible emergence of novel, xray-resistant\nbacterial strains with enhanced capabilities for survival and growth in xray-rich environments.

Furthermore, the refractive indices of xray beams passing through a prism made of Jell-O revealed a\nstrong affinity for 19th-century French impressionist art, as evidenced by the emergence of spectral\nlines corresponding to the wavelengths of light emitted by Monet\u2019s water lilies, which, as we all\nknow, are a type of aquatic plant that thrives in the presence of heavy metal music and has a symbiotic\nrelationship with the aurora borealis, thereby underscoring the importance of accounting for the\nphylogenetic implications of clairvoyance in the context of particle physics and xray technology. In a related study, the effects of xray radiation on the cognitive abilities of coffee machines were\nfound to be significant, with a marked increase in the machines\u2019 capacity for abstract thought and\ncreativity, as measured by their ability to generate sonnets and perform calculus, which, in turn,\nwas correlated with the machines\u2019 propensity for experiencing lucid dreams and their fondness for\nthe music of Bach, which, as is well known, has a profound impact on the crystalline structures of\npineapples and the migratory patterns of sea turtles, thereby suggesting a deep connection between\nthe xray-induced enhancements in coffee machines and the broader universe. The peculiar phenomenon of xray-induced pineapples exhibiting a tendency to levitate in mid-air,\nwhile seemingly defying the laws of gravity and rational explanation, was observed to be accompanied\nby a corresponding increase in the local concentrations of fluorine and radon, which, as we know,\nare essential components of the recipe for a classic martini cocktail, and whose fluctuations, in turn,\nwere correlated with the harmonic series of the musical compositions of Mozart, thereby providing\na fascinating glimpse into the hidden patterns and relationships that underlie the workings of the\nuniverse and the xray-emitting properties of pineapples. In addition, the xray diffraction patterns obtained from a sample of extraterrestrial quartz crystals,\nwhich were purportedly collected by a secret society of ninja warriors from the planet Zorgon, revealed\na striking resemblance to the geometric patterns found in the architecture of ancient Mesopotamian\ntemples, which, as is well known, were designed by a cabal of time-traveling dolphins, and whose\nunderlying mathematical structures, in turn, were shown to be intimately connected to the theoretical\n10frameworks of chaos theory and the culinary art of preparing the perfect croissant, thereby highlighting\nthe profound and mysterious relationships that exist between the realms of xray physics, ancient\nhistory, and pastry baking. The results of the xray fluorescence spectroscopy experiments conducted on a series of antique door\nknobs, which were allegedly crafted by a mystical order of medieval blacksmiths, showed a surprising\ncorrelation with the statistical distributions of winning lottery numbers and the migratory patterns\nof carrier pigeons, which, as we all know, are influenced by the phases of the moon and the secret\ningredients of Coca-Cola, thereby providing a fascinating example of the ways in which the principles\nof xray physics can be applied to the study of seemingly unrelated phenomena and the search for\nhidden patterns and relationships in the universe. 400 0.5\n500 1.2\n600 2.1\nMoreover, the xray absorption coefficients of a sample of Amazonian tree bark, which was collected\nby a team of intrepid explorers and purportedly possesses mystical healing properties, were found\nto exhibit a curious dependence on the local humidity and the proximity to the nearest Starbucks\ncoffee shop, which, as is well known, is a hub of creative energy and a hotbed of innovative thinking,\nand whose baristas, in turn, were observed to be influenced by the xray-induced fluctuations in the\nglobal supply of bacon and the migratory patterns of rare species of butterflies, thereby underscoring\nthe complex and multifaceted nature of the relationships between xray physics, ecology, and coffee\nculture. The xray-induced luminescence of a series of rare earth elements, which were extracted from a batch\nof lunar regolith and purportedly possess unique and exotic properties, was found to be correlated\nwith the statistical distributions of winning poker hands and the harmonic series of the musical\ncompositions of Chopin, which, as we all know, are influenced by the celestial alignments of the\nconstellation Scorpius and the secret ingredients of Dr Pepper, thereby providing a fascinating\nexample of the ways in which the principles of xray physics can be applied to the study of seemingly\nunrelated phenomena and the search for hidden patterns and relationships in the universe. In a related study, the effects of xray radiation on the growth patterns of crystals of sugar and salt\nwere found to be significant, with a marked increase in the crystals\u2019 size and complexity, as measured\nby their fractal dimensions and their propensity for exhibiting strange and exotic properties, such\nas superconductivity and superfluidity, which, as is well known, are influenced by the xray-induced\nfluctuations in the global supply of sushi and the migratory patterns of schools of rare species of fish,\nthereby suggesting a deep connection between the xray-induced enhancements in crystal growth and\nthe broader universe. Furthermore, the xray fluorescence spectroscopy experiments conducted on a series of rare and exotic\ngemstones, which were collected by a team of intrepid adventurers and purportedly possess unique\nand mystical properties, showed a surprising correlation with the statistical distributions of winning\nhorse racing bets and the migratory patterns of rare species of birds, which, as is well known, are\ninfluenced by the xray-induced fluctuations in the global supply of caviar and the secret ingredients\nof haute cuisine, thereby providing a fascinating example of the ways in which the principles of xray\nphysics can be applied to the study of seemingly unrelated phenomena and the search for hidden\npatterns and relationships in the universe. The xray diffraction patterns obtained from a sample of Martian soil, which was collected by a team\nof intrepid astronauts and purportedly possesses unique and exotic properties, revealed a striking\nresemblance to the geometric patterns found in the architecture of ancient Greek temples, which, as\nwe all know, were designed by a cabal of visionary architects and engineers, and whose underlying\nmathematical structures, in turn, were shown to be intimately connected to the theoretical frameworks\nof general relativity and the culinary art of preparing the perfect gyro, thereby highlighting the\nprofound and mysterious relationships that exist between the realms of xray physics, space exploration,\nand Mediterranean cuisine. The results of the xray fluorescence spectroscopy experiments conducted on a series of rare and\nexotic species of deep-sea fish, which were collected by a team of intrepid oceanographers and\npurportedly possess unique and mystical properties, showed a surprising correlation with the statistical\ndistributions of winning lottery numbers and the migratory patterns of schools of rare species of\ndolphins, which, as is well known, are influenced by the xray-induced fluctuations in the global\nsupply of krill and the secret ingredients of fish sauce, thereby providing a fascinating example of\nthe ways in which the principles of xray physics can be applied to the study of seemingly unrelated\nphenomena and the search for hidden patterns and relationships in the universe. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the implementation of xray\ntechnology in various medical facilities has resulted in a significant reduction in the consumption\nof coffee among healthcare professionals, which, in turn, has led to a noticeable decrease in the\noverall productivity of these individuals. In addition to these groundbreaking discoveries, our research has also shed light on the heretofore\nunknown properties of certain types of cheese, which, when exposed to xray radiation, exhibit a\npeculiar tendency to transform into a state of ephemeral gelatinousness. Moreover, our findings\nhave significant implications for the field of culinary arts, where the judicious application of xray\ntechnology can be used to create novel and exciting dishes, such as xray-cured meats and xray-infused\nsauces, which have been found to possess unique and intriguing flavor profiles.

        "Abstract": "Investigating Humanoid Robot Interaction in\nCorporate Settings: A BERT-Based Study of\nHumor-Driven Employee Dynamics\nAbstract\nThis study undertakes a comprehensive examination of the psycholinguistic effects\nof robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, leveraging a BERT-based analysis\nof humanoid punchlines to elucidate the complex interplay between artificial\nhumor and human emotional responses.

        "Methodology": "Through this research, we contribute to a deeper understanding of\nthe intersection of artificial intelligence, humor, and organizational behavior, while\nsimultaneously illuminating the uncharted territories of robot-assisted comedic\nintervention and its far-reaching implications for the future of work. This approach, which involves the\ndeployment of humanoid robots trained to deliver jokes and humorous anecdotes, has been shown to\nhave a profound impact on employee wellbeing and job satisfaction. By leveraging these advanced technologies, researchers are able to gain a deeper understanding of the\ncomplex psycholinguistic mechanisms underlying human humor and laughter. By carefully calibrating the tone and\ncontent of robot-delivered jokes, organizations may be able to influence employee attitudes and\nmotivations, even to the point of inducing a state of \"humor-induced hypnosis.\" By leveraging advanced technologies such as BERT, and exploring the complex\nand often illogical mechanisms underlying human humor, researchers may be able to unlock the full\npotential of robot stand-up comedy as a means of enhancing employee wellbeing and job satisfaction. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to develop a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships\nbetween humans, robots, and humor, and to harness the power of laughter and comedy to create a\nmore positive and productive work environment. Furthermore, the incorporation of machine\nlearning algorithms has enabled robots to adapt their comedic style to suit specific audiences, taking\ninto account factors such as cultural background, personal preferences, and even mood. This research has\nsignificant implications for the development of more sophisticated robotic comedians, as it suggests\nthat a deeper understanding of human humor cognition can inform the design of more effective and\nengaging comedic agents. According to this line of reasoning,\nthe shared experience of embarrassment and discomfort can serve as a social bonding agent, fostering\na sense of communal empathy and camaraderie among coworkers. 3 Methodology\nTo investigate the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, we\nemployed a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and\nanalysis techniques. Our study consisted of two primary phases: data collection and data analysis. In\nthe data collection phase, we recruited 100 participants from various workplaces and asked them to\nwatch a series of stand-up comedy performances by a humanoid robot. We then asked the participants to complete a survey assessing their morale and emotional state before\nand after watching the robot\u2019s performances. The survey included a range of questions, such as\n\"How would you rate your current level of job satisfaction?\" In addition to the survey, we also collected physiological data\nfrom the participants, including heart rate, skin conductance, and facial expressions. In the data analysis phase, we utilized a BERT-based approach to analyze the linguistic patterns and\nstructures of the robot\u2019s punchlines. This included analyzing the use of wordplay, metaphor, and other literary devices, as well as the\ntone, sentiment, and emotional resonance of the language used. We also used a novel approach,\nwhich we termed \"Laughter-Activated Resonance\" (LAR), to analyze the acoustic properties of\nthe participants\u2019 laughter. This involved asking the\nparticipants to place their fingers on the planchette and ask questions related to their morale and\nemotional state. While this approach may be considered unorthodox, it allowed us to tap into the\nparticipants\u2019 subconscious mind and gather data that would have been difficult to obtain through\nmore traditional methods. Furthermore, we conducted a series of interviews with the participants to gather more in-depth,\nqualitative data on their experiences and perceptions of the robot\u2019s stand-up comedy performances. These interviews were designed to explore the participants\u2019 thoughts and feelings in more detail, and\nto gather data on their perceptions of the robot\u2019s humor and comedic style. The interviews were\nconducted in a semi-structured format, with a range of open-ended questions designed to encourage\nthe participants to share their thoughts and feelings in detail. The results of these interviews were\nthen analyzed using a thematic analysis approach, which involved identifying and coding the key\nthemes and patterns that emerged from the data. 3Overall, our methodology was designed to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of\nthe psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale. By combining a range\nof quantitative and qualitative approaches, we were able to gather a rich and detailed dataset that\nprovides valuable insights into the complex and multifaceted nature of human humor and comedy. 4 Experiments\nTo investigate the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, we\ndesigned a series of experiments involving humanoid robots delivering comedic performances to\nhuman participants in a controlled office setting. Participants in the treatment group were exposed to a 30-minute robot stand-up comedy routine,\nwhile those in the control group watched a 30-minute presentation on the history of robotics. The model was programmed to\nproduce punchlines that were tailored to the specific context of the office environment, incorporating\nthemes such as workplace stress, office politics, and the challenges of working with humanoid robots. The punchlines were delivered by a humanoid robot equipped with advanced facial recognition\nsoftware, allowing it to adapt its delivery and tone to the audience\u2019s reactions. This subgroup, dubbed the \"forced laughter\"\ngroup, was designed to test the hypothesis that the act of laughing itself, regardless of the humor\ncontent, could have a positive impact on workplace morale. The experiments also involved a series of cognitive tasks and surveys, designed to assess the partici-\npants\u2019 emotional state, creativity, and overall job satisfaction before and after exposure to the robot\nstand-up comedy routine. The results, presented in Table 1, demonstrate a clear\nrelationship between the degree of logical inconsistency and the resultant morale boost. However, it also raises important questions about\nthe potential risks and consequences of deploying such comedians in real-world workplaces, where\nthe boundaries between humor and reality may become increasingly blurred. The deployment of BERT-based analysis on hu-\nmanoid punchlines has allowed us to uncover subtle yet significant patterns in the way robotic humor\ninfluences human emotional responses. This finding has significant\nimplications for the development of robotic comedy algorithms, as it suggests that the most effective\nhumor generation systems may be those that intentionally incorporate flaws and inconsistencies into\ntheir programming. By embracing the absurd and the irrational, we may\nuncover new and innovative ways to harness the power of humor and promote a more positive,\nresilient, and ultimately absurd work environment.",
        "Results and Findings": "By deploying a custom-designed robot\ncomedian in a series of controlled experiments, we uncover a fascinating paradox\nwherein the most effective humoristic interventions are those that deliberately\nsubvert traditional notions of comedic timing and delivery, instead embracing a\nstaccato, arrhythmic cadence that defies human intuitive expectations. Moreover,\nour findings suggest that the optimal joking frequency for maximizing workplace\nmorale is precisely 4.27 jokes per hour, a figure that appears to be impervious\nto contextual fluctuations in audience mood and demographic composition. In a\nstriking twist, we also discover that the integration of robot stand-up comedy into\nthe work environment precipitates a statistically significant increase in employee\ncreativity, as measured by a proprietary metric dubbed \"Innovation Quotient\" \u2013\nalthough this effect is mysteriously mitigated by the presence of potted plants in\nthe workspace. However, the impact of\nrobots on workplace morale has been a topic of significant interest, with some studies suggesting that\nthe presence of robots can lead to increased stress and anxiety among human employees. For instance, studies\nhave shown that the use of irony and sarcasm in robot-delivered jokes can lead to increased feelings\nof camaraderie and shared experience among human employees, even if the jokes themselves are not\nnecessarily funny. This, in turn, has been shown to have a profound impact\non workplace dynamics, leading to increased productivity, improved communication, and a more\ncohesive team environment. This line of inquiry has yielded some intriguing findings, including the notion that robots can be\nprogrammed to detect and respond to subtle cues in human laughter, effectively creating a comedic\nfeedback loop that amplifies the humorous experience. One notable study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate\nthe neural correlates of humor processing in humans, revealing a complex network of brain regions\ninvolved in the detection, interpretation, and appreciation of comedic stimuli. This data was\ncollected using a range of sensors and cameras, which were discreetly placed throughout the viewing\narea. We trained a BERT model on a dataset of over 10,000 jokes and\npunchlines, and then used this model to analyze the linguistic features of the robot\u2019s performances. This involved using a specialized algorithm to identify the unique sonic\npatterns and frequencies present in the participants\u2019 laughter, and then using these patterns to predict\nthe likelihood of increased morale and job satisfaction. One unexpected finding that emerged from our analysis was the discovery that the participants\u2019\nmorale and emotional state were significantly influenced by the robot\u2019s use of dad jokes. Despite\nbeing widely regarded as cheesy and unfunny, the dad jokes used by the robot were found to have a\nprofound impact on the participants\u2019 sense of well-being and job satisfaction. In fact, our analysis\nsuggested that the use of dad jokes was associated with a 25\nWe also explored the use of an unconventional methodology, which involved using a Ouija board\nto collect data on the participants\u2019 subconscious thoughts and feelings. The results were then analyzed using a combination of qualitative and quantitative\ntechniques, and were found to provide valuable insights into the participants\u2019 subconscious thoughts\nand feelings. The experiments were conducted over a period of\nsix weeks, with a total of 120 participants randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. To our surprise, the results showed that\nthe forced laughter group exhibited a significant increase in morale, despite reporting that they did\nnot find the robot\u2019s jokes amusing. The results were analyzed using a combination of statistical models and\nmachine learning algorithms, including a custom-built variant of the BERT model that incorporated\npsycholinguistic features such as sentiment analysis and emotional tone detection. One of the most striking findings emerged from an exploratory analysis of the participants\u2019 brain\nactivity, which revealed a significant correlation between the robot\u2019s joke delivery and the activation\nof the brain\u2019s reward centers. Specifically, the data showed that the participants\u2019 brains responded to\nthe robot\u2019s punchlines with a release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and\nreward, even when the jokes themselves were not perceived as funny. The results showed that the participants\u2019 brains responded even more strongly\nto these modified jokes, which challenged traditional notions of humor and comedy. The experimental design and results are summarized in the following table: Overall, the experiments\nTable 1: Experimental Design and Results\nGroup Treatment Control Forced Laughter Robot Humor Induction\nSample Size 30 30 20 40\nExposure Time 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes 60 minutes\nPunchline Type Humanoid None Humanoid Absurd\nBrain Activity Dopamine release No effect Dopamine release Increased dopamine release\nMorale Boost Significant No effect Significant Highly significant\n4provided valuable insights into the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace\nmorale, and highlighted the need for further research into the complex and often illogical mechanisms\nunderlying human humor perception. 5 Results\nOur analysis of the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale yielded\nseveral intriguing results. The BERT-based model demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in\nidentifying humanoid punchlines that elicited positive emotional responses from human subjects. For instance, the line \"I\u2019m\nnot sure what\u2019s more pointless, my existence or this meeting\" was found to elicit a 34.7\nIn an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving this phenomenon, we conducted\na series of experiments in which the robot comedian was programmed to generate punchlines that\nwere intentionally illogical and contradictory. This finding has significant implications for the\ndevelopment of robot comedians, as it suggests that the most effective humor may be that which is\nintentionally absurd, illogical, and even nihilistic. Notably, our results suggest that the most effective comedic\ninterventions are those that incorporate a mix of deterministic and probabilistic elements, effectively\ncreating a sense of cognitive dissonance that resonates with human audiences. One of the most unexpected outcomes of our study was the discovery that robot stand-up comedians\nwho incorporated elements of existential dread and absurdity into their routines elicited significantly\nhigher levels of enthusiasm and engagement from human spectators. This finding is particularly\nnoteworthy, as it appears to contradict traditional notions of humor as a means of alleviating stress\nand promoting relaxation. Instead, our data indicate that humans are drawn to robotic comedians\nwho confront them with the meaninglessness and uncertainty of existence, a phenomenon we have\ndubbed \"absurdist humor resonance.\" Furthermore, our analysis revealed a strong correlation between the use of illogical and flawed\nreasoning in robotic comedy routines and the resultant increase in human morale. In a bizarre twist, our research also uncovered evidence to suggest that the physical appearance of the\nrobotic comedian has a profound impact on the perceived humor and effectiveness of their routines. Specifically, we found that robots with asymmetrical or otherwise unconventional body shapes were\nconsistently rated as funnier and more engaging than their symmetrical counterparts. This result\nhas led us to propose the notion of \"comedy morphology,\" wherein the physical design of a robotic\ncomedian influences the way their humor is perceived and processed by human audiences.",
        "Conclusion": "Ultimately, the study of robot stand-up comedy and its effects on workplace morale represents a\nrich and fascinating area of inquiry, one that intersects with a broad range of disciplines, from\nartificial intelligence and natural language processing to cognitive psychology and social theory. This led us to\nconclude that the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale are far\nmore complex and multifaceted than previously thought, and that further research is needed to fully\nunderstand the underlying mechanisms. 6 Conclusion\nIn retrospect, our investigation into the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on work-\nplace morale has yielded a plethora of intriguing findings, some of which challenge conventional\nwisdom and others that defy logical explanation. Ultimately, our study demonstrates the potential for robot stand-up comedy to have a profound impact\non workplace morale, particularly when combined with advanced BERT-based analysis and absurd,\nillogical humor generation techniques. 6"

        "Abstract": "Enhancing Disentanglement through Learned\nAggregation of Convolutional Feature Maps: A Study\non the 2019 Disentanglement Challenge\nAbstract\nThis paper details our submission for stage 2 of the 2019 disentanglement challenge. 1 Introduction\nMethods that are fully unsupervised are unable to learn disentangled representations unless further\nassumptions are made through inductive biases on both the model and the data.",
        "Methodology": "It introduces a straightforward image preprocessing technique for discovering dis-\nentangled latent factors. Our approach involves training a variational autoencoder\nusing aggregated feature maps. These maps are obtained from networks that were\npretrained on the ImageNet database, and we leverage the implicit inductive bias\npresent in those features for disentanglement. This bias can be further strengthened\nby fine-tuning the feature maps with auxiliary tasks such as angle, position estima-\ntion, or color classification. Our method achieved second place in stage 2 of the\ncompetition. Code is publicly available. In our submission, we\nutilize the implicit inductive bias included in models pretrained on the ImageNet database, and then\nimprove it by fine-tuning such models on tasks that are relevant to the challenge such as angle, position\nestimation, or color classification. Our stage 2 submission builds upon our stage 1 submission, in\nwhich we used pretrained CNNs to extract convolutional feature maps as a preprocessing step before\ntraining a V AE. Although this approach provided adequate disentanglement scores, two weaknesses\nwere identified with the feature vectors that were extracted. Secondly, the mechanism for feature aggregation was chosen in an ad-hoc way, and likely did not\nretain all information needed for disentanglement. We address these issues by fine-tuning the feature\nextraction network as well as by learning how to aggregate feature maps from data by using the labels\nof the simulation datasets MPI3d-toy and MPI3d-realistic. 2 Method\nOur method includes three steps: (1) a supervised fine-tuning of the feature extraction CNN, (2)\nextracting a feature vector from each image in the dataset using the fine-tuned network, and (3)\ntraining a V AE to reconstruct the feature vectors and disentangle the latent factors of variation. 2.1 Finetuning the Feature Extraction Network\nIn this step, we fine-tune the feature extraction network offline, before submitting to the evaluation\nserver. The aim is to adapt the network so that it produces aggregated feature vectors that retain the\nnecessary information for disentangling the latent factors of the MPI3d-real dataset. The network is\nfine-tuned by learning to predict the value of each latent factor using the aggregated feature vector of\nan image. To do so, we use the simulation datasets MPI3d-toy and MPI3d-realistic, specifically the\nimages as inputs and the labels as supervised classification targets. The input images are standardized using mean and variance across each channel as computed from\nthe ImageNet dataset. We use the output feature maps from the last layer before the final average\npooling (dimensionality 512 x 2 x 2) as the input to a feature aggregation module which reduces\nthe feature map to a 512-dimensional vector. The aggregation module consists of three convolution\nlayers using 1024, 2048, and 512 feature maps and kernel sizes of 1, 2, and 1 respectively. Each layer\nis followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation. We also utilize layerwise dropout with a\nrate of 0.1 before each convolution layer. Then, for\neach latent factor, we add a linear classification layer that computes the logits of each class using the\naggregated feature vector. We use both MPI3d-toy and MPI3d-realistic for training to push the network to learn features that\nidentify latent factors in a robust way, regardless of details such as reflections or specific textures. We\nsplit each dataset randomly with 80\n2.2 Feature Map Extraction and Aggregation\nIn this step, we use the fine-tuned feature extraction network to produce a set of aggregated feature\nvectors. We simply run the network on each image of the dataset and store the aggregated 512-\ndimensional vectors in memory. Again, inputs to the feature extractor are standardized such that mean\nand variance across each channel correspond to the respective values from the ImageNet dataset. The number of latent factors is determined experimentally. The mean is\nconstrained to the range [0, 1] using the sigmoid activation. All fully connected layers except for the\nfinal ones use batch normalization and are followed by ReLU activation functions. We use orthogonal\ninitialization for all layers and assume a factorized standard normal distribution as the prior p(z)on\nthe latent variables. For optimization, we use the RAdam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, \u03b20= 0.999,\u03b21= 0.9\nand a batch size of 256. The V AE is trained for 120 epochs by maximizing the evidence lower bound,\nwhich is equivalent to minimizing\n1\nBP512\ni=1||\u00b5i\u2212xi||2+ 0.5\u03b2PC\nj=11 +log(\u03c32\nj)\u2212\u00b52\nj\u2212\u03c32\nj\nwhere \u03b2is a hyperparameter to balance the MSE reconstruction and the KLD penalty term. Because\nthe scale of the KLD term depends on the number of latent factors C, we normalize it by C such that \u03b2\ncan be varied independently of C. It can be harmful to start training with too much weight on the KLD\nterm. Therefore, we use the following cosine schedule to smoothly anneal \u03b2from \u03b2start = 0.005to\n\u03b2end= 0.4over the course of training:\n\u03b2(t) ={\u03b2startfort < t start\n1\n2(\u03b2end\u2212\u03b2start)(1 + cos( \u03c0t\u2212tstart\ntend\u2212tstart)) +\u03b2startfort start\u2264t\u2264tend\n\u03b2endfort > t end\nwhere \u03b2(t)is the value for \u03b2in training episode t\u22080, ..., N \u22121, and annealing runs from epoch\ntstart = 10 to epoch tend= 79 . This schedule allows the model to initially learn to reconstruct\nthe data well, and only then puts pressure on the latent variables to be factorized, which improved\nperformance. 23 Discussion\nOur method achieved second place in stage 2 of the competition. Introducing prior knowledge makes the disentanglement task considerably easier, and this is reflected\nin the improved scores. However, our method uses task-specific supervision obtained from simulation,\nwhich restricts its applicability. Nevertheless, this demonstrates that such supervision can transfer to\nbetter disentanglement on real-world data, which was a goal of the challenge.",
        "Results and Findings": "This was empirically found to be important for the resulting disentanglement performance. Compared to our stage 1 approach,\nour stage 2 approach resulted in large improvements on the FactorV AE and DCI metrics.

        "Conclusion": "Finally, the aggregated feature vector is L2-normalized. These linear layers are discarded after this step. 2.3 VAE Training\nFinally, we train a standard \u03b2-V AE on the set of aggregated feature vectors. 3"

Another unexpected approach to analyzing sourdough microbiomes involves the use of fungal\nmycelium-based neural networks, which are essentially networks of fungal hyphae that are trained to\nrecognize patterns in sourdough-related data.",
        "Methodology": "By integrating\nmicrobial genome sequencing data, high-resolution images of bread crumb struc-\ntures, and audio recordings of dough mixing patterns, our model is able to identify\npreviously unknown correlations between microbial community composition and\nbread texture. Interestingly, preliminary studies have suggested that the application of multi-modal transformers\nto sourdough microbiome analysis may also have unforeseen benefits, such as the ability to predict\nthe aesthetic appeal of bread crusts based on the presence of specific microbial metabolites. One notable approach is the use of machine learning algorithms\nto identify patterns in microbiome data, with some researchers proposing the use of convolutional\nneural networks to classify sourdough starters based on their microbiome composition. However,\nthese methods have been limited by their reliance on single-modal data, such as 16S rRNA gene\nsequencing or metabolomics profiles, which only provide a partial view of the sourdough ecosystem. Proponents of this approach argue that fungal mycelium-\nbased neural networks are capable of learning complex relationships between microorganisms and\ntheir environment, and can even be used to control the fermentation process in real-time. While some of these approaches may seem unusual or\neven bizarre, they have the potential to yield new insights into the complex interactions between\nmicroorganisms in sourdough starters, and may ultimately lead to the development of new methods\nfor producing high-quality bread with the perfect crumb. 23 Methodology\nTo investigate the intricate relationships between sourdough microbiomes and the elusive \u2019perfect\ncrumb\u2019, we employed a novel multi-modal transformer architecture. This approach integrated\nmicrobiome sequencing data, high-resolution crumb structure images, and a unique dataset of\nartisanal bakers\u2019 descriptive narratives. The microbiome data was generated using a combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metage-\nnomic analysis, providing a detailed snapshot of the microbial community present in each sourdough\nsample. The descriptive narratives, on the other hand,\nwere collected through a series of in-depth interviews with artisanal bakers, who were asked to\ndescribe the sensory characteristics, texture, and overall appeal of each bread sample. To further augment the model\u2019s capabilities, we introduced a \u2019sonification\u2019 module, which converted\nthe microbiome data into a unique soundscape for each sample. The model\nwas trained using a custom-designed loss function, which balanced the reconstruction accuracy\nof the microbiome data, the perceptual quality of the generated crumb structure images, and the\ncoherence of the descriptive narratives. Through this innovative approach, we aimed to create a\nholistic, multi-faceted understanding of the complex interplay between sourdough microbiomes and\nthe pursuit of the perfect crumb. 4 Experiments\nTo evaluate the efficacy of our proposed Multi-Modal Transformers for analyzing sourdough micro-\nbiomes, we conducted a series of experiments that not only assessed the model\u2019s performance in\npredicting the \u2019perfect crumb\u2019 but also explored unconventional approaches to enhance our under-\nstanding of this complex ecosystem. The experiments were divided into three phases: data collection,\nmodel training, and evaluation. The audio\nrecordings, which we termed \u2019sourdough sonification,\u2019 were obtained by placing a contact microphone\non the dough surface, capturing the subtle vibrations and sounds emitted during fermentation. We\nhypothesized that these audio signals might contain hidden patterns that could inform our model\nabout the underlying microbial dynamics. Our model training phase involved fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer architecture on our dataset,\nwith a twist. We introduced a custom \u2019crumb quality\u2019 loss function that penalized the model for\npredicting anything less than a \u2019perfect crumb.\u2019 This loss function was inspired by the principles of\nchaos theory and involved the use of the Lorenz attractor to introduce randomness and unpredictability\n3into the optimization process. Although this approach seemed counterintuitive, we found that it\nimproved the model\u2019s performance on our validation set. To quantify this effect, we\ncreated a \u2019disco index\u2019 that measured the model\u2019s performance as a function of the amount of disco\nmusic played during training. Surprisingly, our\nmodel outperformed the human experts in 75% of the cases, with the remaining 25% resulting in what\nwe termed \u2019crumb singularity\u2019 \u2013 a phenomenon where the model\u2019s predictions and the human experts\u2019\nassessments converged to produce a crumb that was simultaneously perfect and imperfect. To investigate this further, we plan to conduct a series of experiments involving sourdough\nfermentation in controlled lunar and environmental conditions.",
        "Results and Findings": "By leveraging these transformer-\nbased architectures, researchers can uncover complex patterns and interactions within sourdough\necosystems, potentially leading to breakthroughs in crumb quality and consistency. In a surprising turn of events, a recent experiment involving the application of multi-modal transform-\ners to a dataset of sourdough microbiomes and corresponding bread samples revealed a statistically\nsignificant correlation between the presence of certain microbial taxa and the likelihood of bread\nloaves exhibiting unusual, non-repeating patterns of crust formation. For example, some researchers have used multi-modal transformers to analyze the sounds\nproduced by sourdough starters during fermentation, with the goal of identifying acoustic patterns\nthat are correlated with desirable crumb textures. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it has\nbeen shown to yield surprisingly accurate predictions of crumb quality, with one study reporting a\nsignificant positive correlation between the frequency of CO2 bubbles bursting and the development\nof an open, airy crumb structure. By applying techniques\nsuch as the Lyapunov exponent and the fractal dimension, these researchers have been able to identify\npatterns in sourdough data that are not apparent through other methods. For example, one study found\nthat the fractal dimension of sourdough starters is correlated with their ability to produce bread with\na desirable crumb texture, with higher fractal dimensions corresponding to more open, airy crumb\nstructures. In a surprising twist, we discovered that incorporating a module that analyzed the bakers\u2019 narratives\nfor subtle patterns and emotional undertones significantly improved the model\u2019s performance. Furthermore, we found that feeding the model a steady\ndiet of baking-themed poetry and literary excerpts during the training process had a profound impact\non its ability to generalize to unseen data, supposedly by fostering a deeper understanding of the\ncultural and historical context of bread-making. While this approach may seem unorthodox,\nour preliminary results suggest that the sonification module enables the model to capture subtle,\npreviously unknown relationships between the microbiome and the resulting crumb structure.

        "Methodology": "Second, it fills this gap and proposes to encode tree discontinuities as nearly ordered\npermutations of the input sequence. Third, it studies whether such discontinuous\nrepresentations are learnable. However, many of these approaches come either at a high complexity or low\nspeed, while others give up significant performance to achieve an acceptable latency. Related to these research aspects, this work explores the feasibility of discontinuous parsing under\nthe sequence labeling paradigm, inspired by work on fast and simple continuous constituent parsing. We will focus on tackling the limitations of their encoding functions when it comes to analyzing\ndiscontinuous structures, and include an empirical comparison against existing parsers. This is done by encoding the order of the sentence as\n(nearly ordered) permutations. We present various ways of doing so, which can be naturally combined\nwith the labels produced by existing reductions for continuous constituent parsing. We also shed light on whether general-purpose architectures for NLP tasks can effectively parse\nfree word order languages, and be used as an alternative to adhoc algorithms and architectures for\ndiscontinuous constituent parsing. Traditionally, chart-based parsers relying on this paradigmcommonly suffer from high complexity. Let k be the block degree, i.e. In this sense, it is possible to reorder the tokens while still obtaining a\ngrammatical sentence that could be parsed by a continuous algorithm. This is usually achieved with\ntransition-based parsing algorithms and the swap transition which switches the topmost elements in\nthe stack. For instance, uses this transition to adapt an easy-first strategy for dependency parsing to\ndiscontinuous constituent parsing. In a similar vein, builds on top of a fast continuous shift-reduce\nconstituent parser, and incorporates both standard and bundled swap transitions in order to analyze\ndiscontinuous constituents. system produces derivations of up to a length of n2 n + 1 given a\nsentence of length n. More efficiently, presents a transition system which replaces swap with a gap\ntransition. The intuition is that a reduction does not need to be always applied locally to the two\ntopmost elements in the stack, and that those two items can be connected, despite the existence of a\ngap between them, using non-local reductions. Their algorithm ensures an upper-bound of n(n1)2\ntransitions. With a different optimization goal, removed the traditional reliance of discontinuous\nparsers on averaged perceptrons and hand-crafted features for a recursive neural network approach\nthat guides a swap-based system, with the capacity to generate contextualized representations. replace\nthe stack used in transition-based systems with a memory set containing the created constituents. This model allows interactions between elements that are not adjacent, without the swap transition, to\ncreate a new (discontinuous) constituent. Trained on a 2 stacked BiLSTM transducer, the model is\nguaranteed to build a tree with in 4n-2 transitions, given a sentence of length n.\nA middle ground between explicit constituent parsing algorithms and this paper is the work based on\ntransformations. For instance, convert constituent trees into a nonlinguistic dependency representation\nthat is learned by a transition-based dependency parser, to then map its output back to a constituent tree. A similar approach is taken by, but they proposed a more compact representation that leads to a much\nreduced set of output labels. Other authors such as propose a two-step approach that approximates\ndiscontinuous structure trees by parsing context-free grammars with generative probabilistic models\nand transforming them to discontinuous ones. cast discontinuous phrase-structure parsing into a\nframework that jointly performs supertagging and non-projective dependency parsing by a reduction\nto the Generalized Maximum Spanning Arborescence problem. The recent work by can be also\nframed within this paradigm. They essentially adapt the work by and replace the averaged perceptron\nclassifier with pointer networks, adressing\nIn this context, the closest work to ours is the reduction proposed by, who cast continuous constituent\nparsing as sequence labeling. In the next sections we build on top of their work and: (i) analyze why\ntheir approach cannot handle discontinuous phrases, (ii) extend it to handle such phenomena, and (iii)\ntrain functional sequence labeling discontinuous parsers. Each label, li\nL, is composed of three components li = (ni, xi, ui):\n\u2022ni encodes the number of levels in the tree in common between a word wi and wi+1. To obtain a\nmanageable output vocabulary space, ni is actually encoded as the difference ni ni1, with n1 = 0. We\ndenote by abs(ni) the absolute number of levels represented by ni. nonterminals that belong only to the path from the terminal wi to\nthe root. Note that cannot encode this information in (ni, xi), as these components always represent\ncommon information between wi and wi+1. However, it is easy to prove that its validity does not extend to discontinuous trees, by using\na counterexample. 4 Encoding nearly ordered permutations\nNext, we fill this gap to address discontinuous parsing as sequence labeling. The key to do this\nrelies on a well-known property: a discontinuous tree t T|w| can be represented as a continuous one\nusing an in-order traversal that keeps track of the original indexes (e.g. Thus, if given an input sentence we can generate the position of every word as a terminal in (t), the\nexisting encodings to predict continuous trees as sequence labeling could be applied on (t). We instead propose to explore\nhow to handle this problem in end-to-end sequence labeling fashion, without relying on any parsing\nstructure nor a set of transitions. Todo so, first we denote by \u03c4:{0, . ,|w| \u22121}the permutation that maps the\nposition iof a given wiinwinto its position as a terminal node in \u03c9(t). The crux of defining a viable encoding for discontinuous parsing is then in how we encode tau as\na sequence of values pi, for i = 0 . In other words, permutations tau corresponding to\nreal syntactic trees tend to be nearly ordered permutations. Based on these principles, we propose\nbelow a set of concrete encodings, which are also depicted on an example in Figure 4. Otherwise, we use a special\nlabel INV, which represents that the word is a fixed point in the permutation, i.e., it occupies the same\nplace in the sentence and in the continuous arrangement. permutations of n, namely . For instance, given n = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and a valid\npermutation = [0, 1, 3, 4, 2], then sigma = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Note that the identity permutation would be\nencoded as a sequence of zeros. The Lehmer code is particularly suitable for this task in terms\nof compression, as in most of the cases we expect (nearly) ordered permutations, which translates\ninto the majority of elements of sigma being zero.

In other words, this encoding is expressed following the order of words in the\ncontinuous arrangement rather than the input order, causing a non-straightforward mapping between\ninput words and labels. For the rest of the encodings, the models have a similar number of parameters, as the\nonly change in the architecture is the small part involving the feed-forward output layer that predicts\nthe label component pi. More in detail, for BiLSTMs and vanilla Trans-\nformers, the word embeddings are pre-trained FastText embeddings with 100 dimensions for English\nand 60 for German, and the PoS tags are represented by an embedding layer of 20 dimensions. Additionally we use a char-based LSTM with a hidden layer of 100/132 dimensions (English/German). For both approaches, a linear layer followed by a softmax is used to predict every label component. We use Adam as optimizer and\ncross entropy as the loss function. The learning rate and other hyper-parameters are left as default\nin the transformers library, except for the number of training epochs (we train them for at most 30\nepochs), and the batch size, which is adjusted depending on the memory required by the model (e.g. 8\nfor BERT and 32 for DistilBERT). For the BERT-large model, due to the limitations in GPU memory,\nwe have to reduce the training batch size to 1, and use a smaller learning rate of 1e-5. 5 Experiments\nSetup For English, we use the discontinuous Penn Treebank (DPTB) by. We use the splits by which in turn follow the splits for the NEGRA treebank, the splits\nfor TIGER, and the standard splits for (D)PTB (Sections 2 to 21 for training, 22 for development and\n23 for testing). We consider gold and predicted\nPoS tags. For the latter, the parsers are trained on predicted PoS tags, which are generated by a\n2stacked BiLSTM, with the hyper-parameters used to train the parsers. Model selection is based on overall bracketing F1score. The pointer-based encoding with\nsimplified PoS tags does not lead however to clear improvements, suggesting that the models can learn\nthe sparser original PoS tags set. for TIGER using the vanilla Transformer encoder and BERT). As introduced in \u00a74, we\nhypothesize this is caused by the non-straightforward mapping between words and labels (in the\nLehmer code the label generated for a word does not necessarily contain information about the\nposition of such word in the continuous arrangement). In Table 3 we compare a selection of our models against previous work using both gold and predicted\nPoS tags. Thus, the computation of the contextualized word vectors\nunder current approaches greatly decreases the importance, when it comes to speed, of the chosen\nparsing paradigm used to generate the output trees (e.g. Discussion on other applications It is worth noting that while we focused on parsing as sequence\nlabeling, encoding syntactic trees as labels is useful to straightforwardly feed syntactic information\nto downstream models, even if the trees themselves come from a non-sequence-labeling parser.

In particular, we include: (i) models using the pointer-based encoding, since they obtained\nthe overall best performance on the dev sets, and (ii) a representative subset of encodings (the absolute\npositional one and the Lehmer code of the inverse permutation) trained with the best performing\ntransducer.

which a DNA molecule is replicated\n64 Experiments\nThe experimental design involved a thorough examination of the effects of cheesecake on DNA\nreplication, which somehow led to a discussion on the merits of 19th-century French literature\nand the role of clockwork mechanisms in modern automotive engineering, particularly in relation\nto the aerodynamics of chocolate cakes. In conclusion, our research has led us down a winding path, of discovery, and exploration, that has\nyielded a wealth of new insights, into the mysteries of DNA, and the many ways, in which it intersects,\nwith the world around us.

        "Abstract": "A Decentralized Local Stochastic Extragradient\nApproach for Variational Inequalities\nAbstract\nThis study examines distributed stochastic variational inequalities (VIs) within\nunbounded domains, where the problem data is heterogeneous, meaning it is non-\nidentically distributed and spread across numerous devices. 3 Algorithm\nThis section details our proposed algorithm (Algorithm 1) based on two main concepts: (i) the extra-\ngradient step (as seen in classical methods for VIs), and (ii) gossip averaging (used in decentralized\noptimization and diffusion strategies in distributed learning).",
        "Methodology": "We adopt a broad\nassumption regarding the computational network, which encompasses fully de-\ncentralized computations with dynamic networks and the centralized structures\ncommonly employed in Federated Learning. Additionally, we allow multiple local\nupdates on the workers to reduce how often they communicate. We adapt the\nstochastic extragradient method to this versatile framework, and conduct theoreti-\ncal analysis on its convergence rate, specifically in strongly-monotone, monotone,\nand non-monotone scenarios (given that a Minty solution is available). The rates\nwe provide demonstrate a clear relationship with various network properties like\nmixing time, the number of iterations, data heterogeneity, variance, the quantity\nof devices, and other typical parameters. As a particular application, our method\nand analysis can be used for distributed stochastic saddle-point problems (SPP),\nsuch as the training of Deep Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which is\nknown to be very difficult when using decentralized training. Decentralized training methods can produce an ML model\nwith the same accuracy as if all data were on a single server. Moreover, decentralized training has\nadvantages over traditional centralized methods including data ownership, privacy, fault tolerance, and\nscalability. Therefore, decentralized algorithms are valuable\nwhen centralized communication is expensive, undesirable, or impossible. Recently, significant advances have been made in the creation, design, and understanding of decen-\ntralized training methods. However,\nthese advancements have focused on training with single-criterion loss functions, which lead to\nminimization problems, and are not applicable to more general types of problems. This study centers around solving decentralized stochastic SPPs and, more broadly, decentralized\nstochastic Minty variational inequalities (MVIs). Each device m has access to its own local stochastic oracle Fm(z, m)\nfor the local operator Fm(z) := EmDmFm(z, m). The data m in device m follows a distribution Dm,\nwhich can vary across devices. The devices are connected via a communication network, allowing\ntwo devices to exchange information only if their corresponding nodes are connected by an edge in\nthe network graph. The objective is to find cooperatively a point z* Rn that satisfies the inequality:\nMX\nm=1E[Fm(z\u2217), z\u2212z\u2217]\u22650 (1)\nfor all z Rn. In cases where f(x,y) is convex-concave, the operator F(z) is monotone. In this study, we develop a new algorithm for addressing problems (1) and (2). Therefore, each device uses a local variable, with only approximate consensus among devices\nachieved through gossip steps. Our method avoids multiple gossip steps per iteration, leading to\nbetter practical performance on dynamic networks. It also allows multiple local updates between\ncommunication rounds to reduce communication overhead, making it suitable for communication-\nand privacy-restricted FL or fully decentralized scenarios. Our Contributions:\n1.We have created an algorithm that uses extragradient updates to tackle distributed stochas-\ntic MVIs, and consequently distributed stochastic SPPs, with heterogeneous data. 2.Using this general communication protocol, we have demonstrated the convergence of our\nalgorithm in three MVI settings, namely where the operator is strongly-monotone, monotone,\nor non-monotone (assuming a Minty condition is met). The rates of convergence depend\nexplicitly on several problem parameters, such as network characteristics, data heterogeneity,\ndata variance, number of devices, and other relevant factors. All theoretical\nresults are valid when using heterogeneous data, and allow quantifying how factors like data\nheterogeneity, noise in the data, and network characteristics influence convergence rate. Specifically, we have trained a DCGAN architecture\non the CIFAR-10 dataset. In ML, MVIs and SPPs arise in GANs\ntraining, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training. Instead of using gradient descent, as\nin similar algorithms, ours uses the extragradient method. It also\nincludes local steps between communication rounds, supports dynamic networks, and comes with\nnon-asymptotic theoretical convergence guarantees. The local phase (lines 4\u20136) involves a step of the stochastic\nextragradient method at each node using only local data. Nodes make an extrapolation step \u201cto\nlook into the future\u201d and then update using the operator value at the \u201cfuture\u201d point. Our setting offers great flexibility because the communication\ngraph\u2019s topology can change between iterations. This is encoded in line 2, where Wk is generated using a rule Wk that can vary. Local steps without communication can be encoded with a\ndiagonal matrix Wk.

This assumption guarantees that the consensus between nodes improves by a factor of 1-p after every\ngossip steps. Some matrices Wk can be the identity matrix (local steps only). 4 Setting and Assumptions\nThis section outlines the assumptions used to analyze the proposed algorithm:\nAssumption 3.1 (Lipschitzness). Fm(z, ) is unbiased and has bounded variance. This means, for all\nz:\nE[Fm(z, \u03be)] =Fm(z),E[||Fm(z, \u03be)\u2212Fm(z)||2]\u2264\u03c32(8)\nThe final assumption pertains to the variability of local operators compared to their mean, which is\ncalled D-heterogeneity, and is commonly used when analyzing local-step algorithms. We introduce the notation z = (1/M)m=1M zk for the average iter-\nates and Z = (1/K)k=0K-1 z for the averaged sequence, i.e., ergodic average. Let Assumptions 2.2 and 3.1-3.4 hold, and the sequence z generated\nby Algorithm 1 runs for K > 0 iterations. In contrast to other analyses, our analysis\naddresses the fact that problem (1) has no feasible bounded set, which is important for analysis in\nboth monotone and non-monotone settings. Furthermore, our algorithm includes a communication\nstep that introduces a bias in the oracle, which needs to be analyzed over unbounded feasible sets. We overcome this by bounding the bias, and proving the boundedness in expectation of the sequence\nof iterates for both monotone and non-monotone cases. We achieve this\nunder a general Assumption 2.2, with time varying graphs and all three monotonicity settings. This\nopens meta-optimization opportunities to design networks and set parameters such as M, , and p to\nimprove convergence. The first term\nis from the deterministic case and mirrors existing methods for smooth VIs in a non-distributed\nsetting. In all the cases this does not\nworsen the convergence, because dependence on K is no worse than the stochastic term. Theorem 4.1 is given for a fixed iteration budget K, and corresponding stepsizes that depend on K,\nwhich is standard in literature. We also offer a procedure that allows extending the result to all-time\nconvergence without a priori fixed K, by restarting the algorithm after K iterations, which are doubled\neach time. For decentralized settings, our rate is worse,\nprobably because Assumption 2.2 is more general, but our algorithm is more practical because it\navoids multiple gossip steps per iteration and works with time-varying topologies. And in the non-monotone setting we are\nable to obtain convergence up to a certain accuracy. It is important to note that we use assumptions\nabout iterates that we can obtain only when they are generated by the algorithm. This setup satisfies the assumptions with constants:\n\u00b5=a, L =a2+b2, D = max\nm\u2225Cm\u2225. The dimension is n= 5,b= 1,\nD\u22483, and \u03c4= 1. To obtain stochastic gradients, unbiased Gaussian noise with variance \u03c32is added. In the strongly monotone setting we observe linear\nconvergence up to an error floor determined by the noise and problem parameters. In the supplementary material, we also\nvalidate with decreasing stepsize. We conduct experiments by\nsetting b= 1anda= 1, and measuring how many iterations are needed for\n\r\r\r\r\r1\nMX\nmzk\u2212z\u2217\r\r\r\r\r< \u03f5,\nwhile varying D. The step size is tuned for every experiment. The number of iterations scale as K\u2248\u03f5\u22124, confirming that the error depends on KasO(K\u22121/2). The middle plot shows that iterations scale proportionally to D(D\u2248K). 6.2 Training GANs\nOur method allows for combining communication graph topologies and local steps during distributed\nlearning. This section explores our method on GANs training. Data and model. We use the CIFAR-10 dataset which includes 60,000 images across 10 classes. We\nincrease the dataset four times by adding transformations and noise, and simulate a distributed set\nup using 16 nodes on two GPUs with Ray. We create heterogeneity by splitting the dataset into 16\nsubsets where a major class makes up 20% of the data and the rest is split uniformly between all the\nother classes. We use Adam as the optimizer. We make one local Adam step and one gossip averaging step\nwith time-varying matrices Wk, similarly to Algorithm 1. This\nleads to 120 communication rounds per epoch. A full graph is used every five epochs; otherwise, local steps are taken. This means\n24 communication rounds per epoch on average. At the end of each epoch, clique clusters of size 4 are formed randomly (4 cliques\nin total). This results in 24 communication rounds per epoch. The learning rate is 0.002 for both generator and discriminator. The rest of the parameters are in the\nsupplementary material. 7 Results\nThe methods reach a similar convergence in terms of local epochs and produced similar images. The Local and Cluster topologies perform much better in terms of communication, with the Cluster\ntopology slightly outperforming the Local. This method represents the first\ndecentralized extragradient approach that supports local steps for dynamic network topologies. Future work could extend\nthese algorithms to infinite-dimensional problems.",
        "Results and Findings": "The experiments we\nperform for decentralized GANs training demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed\napproach. In a decentralized stochastic MVI, data is distributed\n.across M or more devices/nodes. These theoretical results\ntranslate directly to the corresponding SPP settings (strongly-convex-strongly-concave,\nconvex-concave, and non-convex-non-concave under the Minty condition). We\nhave also shown that for decentralized settings, our results are novel for time-varying graphs\nand the three different monotonicity settings. 3.We have verified our theoretical results through numerical experiments and demonstrated the\neffectiveness of our strategy in practice. Each step of Algorithm 1 has two phases. A matrix W [0; 1]M \u00d7M is a mixing matrix if it satisfies: 1) W is\nsymmetric, 2) W is doubly stochastic (W1 = 1, 1TW = 1T, where 1 is the vector of all ones), 3) W is\naligned with the network: wij 0 if and only if i = j or the edge (i, j) is in the communication network\ngraph. . .

We also analyze stochastic extragradient\nmethod with biased oracles on unbounded domains which has not been done before. The convergence rates explicitly depend on the network, characterized by mixing time and mixing\nfactor p, and on data heterogeneity D, which appear only as the quantity , the variance 2, Lipschitz\nconstant L, strong monotonicity parameter , and the number of nodes M. These results help us\ndetermine how data heterogeneity, noise, and network characteristics influence convergence. In the strongly monotone case, our rate is slightly better than other results. We manage to obtain\ncorresponding results that can be used for establishing that the algorithm behaves nicely under certain\ninitial conditions. 6 Experiments\nHere we present two experiments to validate the performance of Algorithm 1. 56.1 Verifying Theoretical Convergence Rate\nThis experiment aims to determine whether Algorithm 1\u2019s actual performance matches our theoretical\nrate from Theorem 4.1. The network uses M= 20 nodes with uniform averaging weights. The pvalue is approximately 0.288. We\nsee that when a constant stepsize is used in stochastic optimization algorithms, convergence is usually\nlimited to a certain neighborhood, see Theorem 2 in a previous study. We verify the dependence on the heterogeneity parameter Dand set the noise \u03c32= 0. In Section A.1, we discuss the\nrelevance of our theoretical results to GANs training. In\nnumerical experiments, we validated that the dependency on the data heterogeneity parameter D is\ntight in the SM case and impossible to improve in general. 7",
        "Conclusion": "Lastly, we see the number\nof iterations to reach \u03f5= 0.01while varying the graph parameter p, and observe D\u2248p\u00b7K. This\nmeans that experiments confirm the O\u0010\n1\npDK2\u0011\nterm in the convergence rate. A full graph is used at the end of each epoch; otherwise, local steps are taken. \u2022Local. 8 Conclusion\nWe have developed an effective algorithm to solve decentralized stochastic MVIs and SPPs, assuming\na highly flexible network topology and communication constraints. We\ntheoretically demonstrated the convergence rate of the algorithm for SM, M, and NM cases. By training DCGAN in a decentralized\nmanner, we showed our method\u2019s effectiveness for practical DL tasks."
